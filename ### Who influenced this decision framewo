### Who influenced this decision framework

- **You (the user)**: Your provided governance model set the core levers and rationale—hybrid linearity (α), exponential penalties, and capped uplift (β). Your docs like `### How I decide, step by step.md` and `### What “blockers” are` guided structure and thresholds.
- **Decision theory**: Standard Bayesian decision theory and proper scoring rules motivated calibrated posteriors and threshold policies (why we gate on Ψ).
- **Risk modeling**: Multiplicative/exponential discounting for independent risks (common in reliability/survival models) informed the penalty form.
- **Optimization/learning**: RL/bandits literature suggested when to add learning layers only if rewards/feedback exist.
- **MCDA/policy design**: Multi-criteria methods and rule engines informed how to encode stakeholder constraints and map them to α and hard gates.
- **Operational safety norms**: Software engineering best practices (non‑interactive ops, CI/test gating, reversibility) shaped the action gates and defaults.

If you want, I can add short citations to your repo doc (textbook/paper anchors) or a references section.

- Influences: your governance docs; decision theory; exponential risk models; RL/MCDA; operational safety norms.
- Emphasis: no single person—principles and your ruleset shaped the Ψ framework.
