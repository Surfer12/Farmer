Preparing mathematical presentation
I'm outlining a mathematical presentation where I'll define key concepts like axioms and then present the theorem showing that the Ψ aggregator is the unique solution satisfying those axioms. I want to include a proof with steps related to functional equations and the implications of a mixture model. I also need to mention alternatives that violate the axioms, providing concise bullets. Even though we aren’t using tools, I think it’s still good to provide a quick status update at the start.
Drafting the mathematical theorem
I'm starting to draft a theorem focused on the axiomatic justification for the Ψ function. First, I’ll define key elements like S, N, α, and other variables along with the function itself. Then, I plan to outline axioms D1-D6, covering aspects such as boundedness, monotonicity, and allocation transparency. The theorem will establish that Ψ is unique under those axioms, particularly regarding its linear blend and exponential characteristics. Finally, I’ll include a proof with Lemma 1 detailing the risk aggregator.
Outlining the proof details
I’m working through some proofs related to Cauchy's equation, showing that log g is additive, leading to g(r) being expressed as an exponential function involving λ constants. Next, I’ll detail Lemma 2, discussing the mixture operator h, which should satisfy certain conditions like continuity and transparency. For Lemma 3, I want to show how the calibrator functions must increase and be capped at 1. Finally, I’ll combine these findings to express Ψ with a note about uniqueness concerning parameter scaling.
Summarizing properties and results
I’m analyzing the properties of the Ψ function, focusing on its derivative with respect to α, which shows negative signs when N is greater than S. This indicates canonical promotion monotonicity and establishes a Lipschitz bound. I’ll also mention the corollary that threshold policies on Ψ are Bayes-optimal for binary decisions. Then, I want to conclude that our framework is unique and minimal, pointing out that alternatives violate specific axioms, like logistic failing in transparency or full Bayes not meeting auditability.

Quick status: I’ll state Ψ explicitly, lay out axioms (the desiderata), prove that Ψ is the unique minimal form satisfying them (via three lemmas), and note the threshold-policy corollary that justifies action gates. No blockers.

### Theorem (axiomatic justification for sticking with Ψ)
Let S,N∈[0,1] denote internal and canonical signal strengths, α∈[0,1] an allocation lever, r=(R_a,R_v)∈[0,1]^2 risk terms with weights λ=(λ_1,λ_2)>0, and β≥1 an uplift. Define
Ψ(S,N,α,r,λ,β) = min{ β · [ α S + (1−α) N ] · exp(−[λ_1 R_a + λ_2 R_v]), 1 }.

Under the axioms A1–A6 below, Ψ is (up to trivial reparameterization of λ and β) the unique minimal-complexity aggregator. Therefore it is the principled choice, and thresholding Ψ yields optimal act/ask gates for standard costs.

Axioms (operational desiderata)
- A1 Boundedness and order: output in [0,1]; strictly increasing in evidence quality and decreasing in each risk; preserves ranking.
- A2 Canonical monotonicity: if canonical evidence improves (N increases, R_a/R_v decrease), the score does not decrease for any α.
- A3 Allocation transparency: evidence combiner is affine and its sensitivity to α is constant (auditably linear trade between S and N).
- A4 Independent risks: joint risk discount decomposes multiplicatively over independent components and is continuous.
- A5 Calibration with cap: a single uplift β scales confidence, capped at 1, preserving order.
- A6 Minimality/auditability: fewest degrees of freedom; closed form; parameters map directly to observable triggers.

Lemma 1 (Exponential risk discount)
Let g: [0,1]^k → (0,1] satisfy: g(0)=1; g is continuous, strictly decreasing in each coordinate; and g(u+v)=g(u)g(v) whenever u,v and u+v are in the domain (independent risks add in “risk space” and multiply in effect). Then there exist λ_i>0 with g(r)=exp(−∑_i λ_i r_i).
Sketch: Define h(r)=−log g(r). Then h(0)=0, h is continuous, nonnegative, increasing, and additive: h(u+v)=h(u)+h(v). On each axis, Cauchy’s functional equation with continuity gives h(t e_i)=λ_i t. By multilinearity over orthants, h(r)=∑_i λ_i r_i. Hence g(r)=exp(−∑_i λ_i r_i).

Lemma 2 (Linear evidence blend)
Let h: [0,1]^2×[0,1]→[0,1] satisfy: h is continuous; h(S,S,α)=S (idempotence); h is affine in S and N for each fixed α; and ∂h/∂α is constant w.r.t. α (transparent sensitivity). Then h(S,N,α)=α S+(1−α) N.
Sketch: Affinity implies h = a(α)S + b(α)N + c(α). Idempotence with S=N gives a(α)+b(α)=1 and c(α)=0. Constant ∂h/∂α forces a(α)=α and b(α)=1−α up to an additive constant, which idempotence eliminates.

Lemma 3 (Minimal calibrated cap)
Let c: [0,1]→[0,1] be increasing, with c(0)=0, c(1)=1, and “β‑uplift then cap”: for small y, slope β; for large y, bounded by 1; order-preserving. Among such maps, c(y)=min{β y, 1} is the pointwise minimal choice and uniquely 1‑Lipschitz beyond the knee.
Sketch: Any order-preserving uplift with slope ≤β that caps at 1 majorizes y↦min{β y,1}. Equality of slopes on [0,1/β] and tight cap at 1 force the piecewise-linear form.

Proof of Theorem
By A4 and Lemma 1, the only admissible joint risk penalty is pen(r)=exp(−[λ_1 R_a+λ_2 R_v]). By A3 and Lemma 2, the only admissible evidence combiner is O(α)=α S+(1−α)N. By A5 and Lemma 3, the only minimal uplift-with-cap is c(y)=min{β y,1}. Composing these (A1–A2 ensure monotonicity and boundedness are preserved) yields Ψ = c(O(α)·pen(r)). Uniqueness holds up to scaling λ and β, which are exactly the tunable levers in the framework. Thus Ψ is the unique minimal solution satisfying A1–A6.

Properties that justify action gates and operational use
- Monotonicity w.r.t. canon: If N increases or R_a/R_v decrease, then O increases and pen increases, so Ψ does not decrease; if N>S then ∂Ψ/∂α = (S−N)·pen·β below the cap, strictly negative, so shifting weight to canon raises Ψ.
- Bounded, stable sensitivity: 0≤Ψ≤1; below cap, |∂Ψ/∂α| ≤ |S−N|·β·exp(−[λ_1 R_a+λ_2 R_v]); at cap, derivative is 0, further stabilizing decisions.
- Threshold optimality: In a binary act/ask decision with standard convex loss and Ψ as a monotone sufficient score, Bayes decision theory yields a threshold rule as optimal; hence fixed gates on Ψ minimize expected loss.

Why alternatives fail the axioms (hence we don’t use them by default)
- Softmax/logistic blends violate A3 (non‑transparent α), complicate A2 sensitivity, and obscure parameter auditability (A6).
- Additive penalties violate A1 unless re‑clamped and break multiplicative independence (A4).
- Full Bayes meets A1–A2 but violates A6 (complex priors/inference; latency); RL requires rewards and exploration (outside A1–A6).
- Rule engines/MCDA satisfy A6 but not A1–A2 as continuous uncertainty aggregators; we use them as constraints/weight sources feeding α or pre‑gates.

Conclusion
Given A1–A6, Ψ is the uniquely determined, minimal, auditable aggregator. Its monotonicity, boundedness, and threshold optimality directly support safe, fast, reproducible decisions—hence we stick to Ψ by default and compose Bayes/RL/MCDA around it only when their preconditions hold.

- Formalized Ψ, set axioms (boundedness, canonical monotonicity, transparent allocation, independent risks, capped calibration, minimality).
- Proved Ψ is uniquely determined (linear blend, exponential penalty, capped uplift) via three lemmas.
- Noted threshold optimality and why alternatives violate at least one axiom; thus Ψ is the principled default.
