## Java style & safety

- Naming & clarity: descriptive, full words; functions are verbs, variables are nouns.
- Immutability: prefer records/unmodifiable collections; avoid shared mutable state.
- Concurrency: guard clauses, early returns, simple synchronization; keep cyclomatic complexity low.
- Comments: explain "why"; avoid obvious how-comments; keep concise.
- Testing/CI: run Java build and demos after edits; keep CI green; add unit tests for new public APIs.
- Licensing headers: include SPDX on all files; code GPL-3.0-only; internal docs LicenseRef-Internal-Use-Only.
