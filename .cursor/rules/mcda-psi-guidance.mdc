## MCDA practical wiring with Ψ

- Flow: Rules → prune feasible set F → compute Ψ(a) (α evidence-only) → MCDA over criteria c(a)=[Ψ, cost, value, time,…].
- Choose MCDA M monotone in Ψ (e.g., WSM/WPM, TOPSIS with monotone normalization, AHP-derived weights) and select argmax M(c,w).
- Do not encode stakeholder preference into α; keep weights w separate from evidence.

## Invariance conditions
- Gauge freedom: renames/defaults that leave Ψ unchanged ⇒ rankings unchanged.
- Threshold transfer: if β→β′ (sub-cap), use τ′ = τ·(β/β′); keep w unchanged.
- Sensitivity invariants: if M is strictly increasing in Ψ holding others fixed, ordering by Ψ propagates to final ranking.
- Caveat: saturation at cap can break scaling invariance; log and review.

## Do/Don’t
- Do: WSM/WPM, TOPSIS (monotone), AHP weights.
- Don’t: non-monotone use of Ψ (band/inverted-U) or couplings that make M non-increasing in Ψ.

## Minimal checks
- Monotonicity test on Ψ with others fixed.
- Threshold-transfer A/B: β→β′ with τ′ mapping keeps accept set/ranks (sub-cap).
- Saturation audit: count items at cap; investigate rank changes.
