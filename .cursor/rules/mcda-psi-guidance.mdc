# Ψ + MCDA Composition Guidance

- Treat Ψ as the continuous evidence channel. Use rules to prune first, then MCDA strictly for preferences.
- Keep `α` (allocation) evidence-only; keep MCDA weights `w` preference-only.
- Use a monotone MCDA aggregator in Ψ (e.g., WSM/WPM/TOPSIS with positive weights and monotone normalization).
- Threshold transfer: when uplift β changes, in sub-cap region use `τ' = τ·(β/β')` to preserve accept/reject; do not change `w`.

Do’s / Don’ts:
- Do: weighted sum/product, TOPSIS, AHP-derived weights.
- Don’t: non-monotone use of Ψ (band penalties, inverted-U), or couplings that make M non-increasing in Ψ.

Minimal checks:
- Verify M increases when Ψ increases with other criteria fixed.
- A/B threshold-transfer test preserves accept set and ranks for previously sub-cap items.
