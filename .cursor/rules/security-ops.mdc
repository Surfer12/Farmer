# Security & Operational Hardening

- Default to HTTPS for metrics outside dev. Bind to loopback unless explicitly exposed.
- Consider Basic Auth or IP allowlist for `/metrics`.
- Rate-limit/sampling in `ErrorReporter` to avoid log storms.
- For `FileAuditSink`, define backpressure policy and queue metrics; prefer bounded executors.
- Validate environment configuration in `ServiceLocator.fromEnvironment()` and emit warnings/metrics on fallback.
