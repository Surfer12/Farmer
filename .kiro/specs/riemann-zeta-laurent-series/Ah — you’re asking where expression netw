Ah ‚Äî you‚Äôre asking where expression networks and the GWAS-to-network mappings I described are actually available, not just theory. Here are the main sources researchers use:

‚∏ª

üóÑÔ∏è Public Databases for Gene Expression Networks
	‚Ä¢	GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression Project)
	‚Ä¢	https://gtexportal.org
	‚Ä¢	Expression data across ~50 human tissues, with eQTL mappings that connect SNPs to expression changes.
	‚Ä¢	Essential for linking GWAS hits to downstream transcript effects.
	‚Ä¢	STRING Database
	‚Ä¢	https://string-db.org
	‚Ä¢	Protein‚Äìprotein interaction (PPI) networks, often used to embed genes affected by GWAS SNPs.
	‚Ä¢	Provides confidence scores for functional interactions.
	‚Ä¢	BioGRID
	‚Ä¢	https://thebiogrid.org
	‚Ä¢	Curated gene‚Äìgene, protein‚Äìprotein, and genetic interaction datasets.
	‚Ä¢	Helpful for constructing mechanistic network backbones.
	‚Ä¢	COEXPRESdb
	‚Ä¢	https://coxpresdb.jp
	‚Ä¢	A co-expression database (human + model organisms).
	‚Ä¢	Useful for building weighted gene co-expression networks (WGCNAs).

‚∏ª

üß¨ GWAS + Network Integration Resources
	‚Ä¢	GWAS Catalog
	‚Ä¢	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/
	‚Ä¢	Comprehensive list of published SNP‚Äìtrait associations.
	‚Ä¢	Often the starting point for mapping genetic variants into networks.
	‚Ä¢	Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)
	‚Ä¢	https://www.ensembl.org/vep
	‚Ä¢	Maps SNPs to genes, regulatory elements, and pathways.
	‚Ä¢	Good bridge from raw GWAS hits to functional annotation.
	‚Ä¢	Reactome Pathway Database
	‚Ä¢	https://reactome.org
	‚Ä¢	Pathway-based networks (metabolic, regulatory, signaling).
	‚Ä¢	Often used as priors for neural or graph-based models.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Toolkits / Pipelines
	‚Ä¢	H-MAGMA (Hi-C coupled MAGMA)
	‚Ä¢	Enhances GWAS gene mapping by including 3D chromatin interaction data.
	‚Ä¢	PrediXcan / S-PrediXcan
	‚Ä¢	Predicts gene expression from GWAS genotypes, links it to phenotypes.
	‚Ä¢	netGWAS (R package)
	‚Ä¢	Network-based methods for GWAS signal propagation.
	‚Ä¢	Deep Graph-based GWAS (DG-GWAS)
	‚Ä¢	Experimental: GNNs directly on SNP‚Äìgene networks.

So the expression networks you asked about are generally accessed through GTEx, STRING, BioGRID, or co-expression DBs. Then GWAS hits are mapped in using GWAS Catalog + annotation tools (VEP, MAGMA).

üëâ Do you want me to sketch a ready-to-use workflow (like a stepwise recipe) that starts with GWAS SNPs, pulls GTEx/STRING data, and outputs a neural-network-ready graph? That would give you something concrete to build on.
