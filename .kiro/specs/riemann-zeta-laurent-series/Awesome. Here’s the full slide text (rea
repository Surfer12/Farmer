Awesome. Here’s the full slide text (ready to drop into PPTX/Keynote) using your preferred naming (iXcan/SiXcan), with notation, a stepwise confidence trail (Ψ) with annotated weights, and auditability/regulatory language baked in.

From GWAS to Actionable Insight: Network Models Enhanced by Genetic Data

2) Executive Summary

Problem: GWAS = associations, not decisions. PRS is opaque and weakly mechanistic.
Solution: iXcan/SiXcan + Network Models map SNPs → tissue-specific gene expression → pathway-aware predictions.
Why now: Pretrained eQTL models + graph/dynamical learning + auditability = enterprise-grade.
Regulatory: Auditable & reproducible pipeline supports FDA/EMA filings via full provenance and traceable model decisions.

⸻

3) The Gap We Close
	•	Today: Variant lists & PRS with limited interpretability.
	•	We deliver: Tissue-specific gene-level effects (iXcan/SiXcan), embedded in biological networks, simulated with GNNs / NODE-RK4 / Koopman for actionable concentration/risk trajectories.
	•	Outcome: Fewer late-stage R&D failures; safer dosing; transparent, defendable models.

⸻

4) Pipeline Overview (Auditable & Reproducible)

Inputs: GWAS genotypes or summary stats; tissue model weights; pathway graph.
Steps:
	1.	iXcan/SiXcan: predict \hat{E}_{g,t} (tissue-specific expression) from SNPs/stats
	2.	Gene-level association: link \hat{E}_{g,t} to phenotype Y
	3.	Network embedding: map genes to pathways (STRING/Reactome/BioGRID)
	4.	Neural dynamics: GNN / NODE-RK4 / Koopman for trajectories
	5.	Ψ(x) hybrid layer: symbolic constraints, calibration, confidence
Outputs: Concentration/time curves, risk trajectories, interpretable drivers
Provenance: Data sources, model versions, checksums, commits, seeds

⸻

5) Notation & Symbols (Legend)
	•	i: SNP index; g: gene; t: tissue; Y: phenotype
	•	iXcan/SiXcan mapping:
\hat{E}{g,t} = \sum{i} w_{g i,t}\,\text{SNP}i  (iXcan, individual-level)
Z{g,t}^{\text{SiXcan}} \propto \sum_{i} w_{g i,t}\,\hat{\beta}i / \sqrt{\sum_i w{g i,t}^2 \hat{\sigma}_i^2}  (summary-based)
	•	Network graph: \mathcal{G}=(V,E), V=\{g\}, edges E from PPIs/pathways
	•	GNN layer: h_g^{(\ell+1)}=\phi\!\left(h_g^{(\ell)}, \square_{u\in \mathcal{N}(g)}\psi(h_g^{(\ell)},h_u^{(\ell)},e_{g,u})\right)
	•	NODE-RK4: \dot{x}=f_\theta(x,t), 4-stage RK update for concentrations x
	•	Koopman: x_{k+1}\approx K\,\Phi(x_k), linear evolution in lifted space
	•	Ψ(x) meta-optimization:
\Psi = \Big(\alpha S + (1-\alpha)N\Big)\cdot \underbrace{e^{-\,[\lambda_1 R_a+\lambda_2 R_v]}}{\text{penalty}}\cdot \underbrace{\min\{\beta\,P(H\!\mid\!E),1\}}{\text{capped posterior}}

⸻

6) iXcan/SiXcan: Genotype → Tissue Expression (Mechanism)
	•	Weights w_{g i,t} from eQTL models (GTEx-derived) project SNPs to gene expression \hat{E}_{g,t}.
	•	SiXcan consumes GWAS summary stats \hat{\beta}i to produce gene-level Z Z{g,t}.
	•	Interpretation: gene-level, tissue-specific signals are mechanistically meaningful features, not just SNP bags.

⸻

7) Gene → Phenotype (Association Layer)
	•	Model: Y = \beta_{g,t}\,\hat{E}_{g,t} + \epsilon (per gene/tissue); multi-tissue stacking via meta-analysis.
	•	Outcome: coherent gene/tissue effect sizes \{\beta_{g,t}\} for downstream modeling.
	•	Control: covariates, ancestry PCs, batch; FDR control for gene/tissue families.

⸻

8) Network Embedding (Biology as a Prior)
	•	Map \{\beta_{g,t}, \hat{E}_{g,t}\} onto pathways (STRING/Reactome/BioGRID).
	•	Create node features h_g^{(0)}=[\hat{E}{g,t}, Z{g,t}, \beta_{g,t}, \text{covars}].
	•	Why it matters: propagates local gene signals into system-level effects (pathway dynamics).

⸻

9) Dynamics: GNN / NODE-RK4 / Koopman
	•	GNN: captures nonlinear pathway crosstalk → risk/concentration embeddings.
	•	NODE-RK4: simulates in vivo concentration trajectories x(t) respecting ODE kinetics.
	•	Koopman: stable long-horizon disease progression forecasts in a linear lifted space.
	•	Constraint hooks: mass balance, pathway conservation enforced downstream (Ψ layer).

⸻

10) Ψ(x) Hybrid Interpretability & Safety

\Psi = (\alpha S + (1-\alpha)N)\cdot e^{-\,[\lambda_1 R_a+\lambda_2 R_v]}\cdot \min\{\beta P(H|E),1\}
	•	Hybrid linearity: \alpha shifts weight to canonical sources as they arrive.
	•	Penalty: R_a (authority risk), R_v (verifiability risk) keep \Psi\in(0,1].
	•	Capped posterior: prevents runaway confidence (regulatory checkbox).
	•	Outcome: interpretable uplift, biologically plausible predictions, auditable promotions.

11) Confidence Trail (Stepwise, Annotated Weights)

Per step, we log \alpha, S, N, R_a, R_v, \beta, P(H|E) and compute \Psi.

Step	Source class	Key weights	Example inputs	Confidence calc
A. iXcan/SiXcan	Canonical (GTEx model ver. X.Y)	w_{g i,t}	tissue=Liver; hash=abc123	\alpha=0.7, S=0.9, N=0.6, R_a=0.1, R_v=0.1, \beta=1.0 \Rightarrow \Psi_A
B. Assoc. Y\leftarrow\hat{E}	Expert (internal stats)	\beta_{g,t}	covars OK; FDR q=0.05	\alpha=0.5, S=0.8, N=0.7, R_a=0.2, R_v=0.2, \beta=0.9 \Rightarrow \Psi_B
C. Network embed	Canonical+Expert	edges e_{g,u}	STRING v11.5; conf≥0.7	\alpha=0.6, \dots \Rightarrow \Psi_C
D. Dynamics	Neural (GNN/NODE/Koop)	\theta	val AUROC=0.87	\alpha=0.4,\dots \Rightarrow \Psi_D
E. Ψ layer	Hybrid	\lambda_1,\lambda_2	audit pass ✅	Final \Psi (reported & logged)

(Numbers are template placeholders; in production these are auto-populated & versioned.)

12) Pre-Weighting Challenge (and Fix)

Issue: iXcan/SiXcan depends on pretrained GTEx eQTL weights → cohort bias (age, ancestry, tissue sampling).
Risk: Frozen priors overfit legacy cohorts and underperform in under-represented populations.
Solution (Ψ-hybrid reweighting):
	•	Dynamic prior shift: when canonical new eQTL panels (population-specific) appear, decrease \alpha toward external evidence; update w_{g i,t} \mapsto \tilde{w}_{g i,t}.
	•	Algorithm (sketch):
	•	Compute divergence D(\text{cohort}{\text{prod}} \parallel \text{cohort}{\text{GTEx}}).
	•	Set \Delta\alpha = \kappa \cdot D; update \lambda_1,\lambda_2 to reflect authority/verifiability deltas.
	•	Re-estimate \beta_{g,t} under \tilde{w}; re-propagate through network & dynamics.
Net effect: Prevents overfitting while preserving audit trail (all deltas logged).

⸻

13) Regulatory: Auditability & Reproducibility (FDA/EMA Support)
	•	Traceable decisions: variant → w_{g i,t} → \hat{E}{g,t} → \beta{g,t} → pathway edges → simulator → prediction.
	•	Provenance log:
	•	Data DOIs (GWAS), model versions (GTEx/iXcan/SiXcan), graph DB versions, code commit SHAs, container digests, random seeds.
	•	Checksums for weight files; config snapshots; model cards with intended use & limits.
	•	Reproducibility pack: one-click re-run script, expected hashes, validation reports.
	•	Positioning: Supports FDA/EMA filings by providing auditable, reproducible artifacts. (No claims of regulatory approval.)

⸻

14) Use Case: Drug Concentrations In Vivo (Metabolism)
	•	Cyclosporine: SNPs → SiXcan (liver) → CYP3A4/5, ABCB1 expression → NODE-RK4 concentration trajectory x(t).
	•	Ψ checks: mass balance, pathway conservation; capped posterior for safe confidence.
	•	Output: Interpretable dosing guidance with full audit trail (filing-ready).

⸻

15) Use Case: Disease Progression (Oncology, Alzheimer’s)
	•	Patient-level graphs: GWAS + SiXcan features as node attributes.
	•	Koopman operator for stable long-term forecasts; GNN captures nonlinear crosstalk.
	•	Audit: explicit variant → expression → pathway contribution logs at prediction time.

⸻

16) Use Case: Synthetic Biology (Yield Optimization)
	•	CRISPR designs: simulate metabolite trajectories under gene edits.
	•	Ψ constraints: biochemical feasibility; conservation laws; bounded confidence.
	•	Result: higher-probability wet-lab wins with transparent rationales.

⸻

17) Validation & Governance
	•	Holdout & external cohorts; ancestry-aware eval; sensitivity to w updates.
	•	Ablations: PRS vs iXcan/SiXcan vs +Network vs +Ψ.
	•	Model risk mgmt: drift detectors on \hat{E}{g,t}, \beta{g,t}, and simulator residuals; audit alarms on \Psi drops.

⸻

18) Deployment & ROI
	•	Infra: Dockerized; AWS/GCP/Azure/HPC; API endpoints; EMR integration.
	•	Time-to-value: summary stats → SiXcan → pilot models fast.
	•	ROI: target triage (fewer dead-ends), safer dosing (fewer ADEs), fewer wet-lab iterations.

⸻

19) Call to Action
	•	Pilot proposal: select indication/cohort; stand up SiXcan+Network+Ψ; deliver audited report.
	•	Workshop: data science + clinical teams; compliance & IT stakeholders.
	•	Next step: access to GWAS stats, tissue list, pathway scope; timeline & owner.

Appendix A — Confidence Math (One-pager)
	•	Hybrid linearity: O(\alpha)=\alpha S+(1-\alpha)N, monotone in external evidence.
	•	Penalty: \text{pen}=\exp(-[\lambda_1 R_a+\lambda_2 R_v]), multiplicative, bounded.
	•	Posterior cap: P^*(H|E,\beta)=\min\{\beta\,P(H|E),1\}.
	•	Sensitivity: \partial \Psi/\partial \alpha=(S-N)\cdot \text{pen}\cdot P^*(H|E,\beta) (bounded; no runaway).
