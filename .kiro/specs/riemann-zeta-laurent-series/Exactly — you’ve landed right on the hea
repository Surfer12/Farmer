Exactly — you’ve landed right on the heart of the Prime Number Theorem (PNT) and its analytic proof. Let’s unpack this in a clean, stepwise way:

⸻

1. The PNT Statement

\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x}, \quad x \to \infty,
where \pi(x) is the prime-counting function.

This means that the density of primes near x is about 1/\log x.

2. Why ζ(s) matters

The Riemann zeta function:
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}, \quad \Re(s)>1,
has an Euler product representation:
\zeta(s) = \prod_{p \ \text{prime}} \frac{1}{1 - p^{-s}}, \quad \Re(s)>1.

This shows ζ(s) is a generating function for primes.
In fact, if ζ(s) had no Euler product, there would be no PNT.

3. The pole at s = 1
	•	\zeta(s) has a simple pole at s=1 with residue 1:
\zeta(s) \sim \frac{1}{s-1} + \gamma + \cdots, \quad s \to 1^+.
	•	This singularity controls the growth of \pi(x).
Through complex analysis (via Perron’s formula and contour integrals), one extracts the main term:
\pi(x) \sim \operatorname{Li}(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x}.

4. What if the analytic structure were different?
	•	Different residue at s=1:
Suppose
\zeta(s) \sim \frac{C}{s-1}, \quad C\neq 1.
Then the main term would scale:
\pi(x) \sim C \cdot \frac{x}{\log x}.
So the prime density would be off by a constant factor.
	•	Additional poles near s=1:
A pole at s=1+\varepsilon with \varepsilon>0 would blow up the density — primes would be far denser than reality.
A pole at s=1-\varepsilon would introduce lower-order but growing corrections to \pi(x).
	•	Zeros near s=1:
Nontrivial zeros of ζ(s) (the ones in the critical strip) produce oscillatory error terms in \pi(x).
Specifically, if ζ(s) has a zero at s=\rho, then contributions of the form:
x^\rho / \rho
appear in the explicit formula for \pi(x).
If a zero lay on \Re(s)=1, it would destroy the asymptotic \pi(x)\sim x/\log x.
This is why proving that ζ(s) has no zeros on the line \Re(s)=1 was the key step in Hadamard and de la Vallée-Poussin’s proof of the PNT.
