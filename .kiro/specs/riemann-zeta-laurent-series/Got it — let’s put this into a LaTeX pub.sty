\begin{abstract}
Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of SNP--trait associations, yet these signals remain largely correlational and lack mechanistic resolution. Here, we present a hybrid framework combining iXcan/SiXcan gene expression imputation with network-based neural simulation and a symbolic--neural interpretability layer, $\Psi(x)$. This approach yields actionable predictions for drug metabolism, disease progression, and synthetic biology design, while ensuring auditable and reproducible outputs suitable for regulatory filings (FDA/EMA). We also address the pre-weighting challenge of eQTL-derived models and propose post-quantum provenance methods for traceable compliance.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Traditional GWAS produces variant lists or polygenic risk scores (PRS) that are insufficient for actionable predictions. By contrast, the integration of iXcan/SiXcan---which maps SNPs to tissue-specific gene expression---with graph-based and dynamical models enables mechanistically grounded inference. Our framework enhances this pipeline with a hybrid interpretability layer, $\Psi(x)$, ensuring biologically plausible and regulatory-compliant outputs.

\section{iXcan/SiXcan: SNP $\rightarrow$ Expression Mapping}
The iXcan/SiXcan framework imputes tissue-specific expression from genotype or GWAS summary data:
\[
\hat{E}_{g,t} = \sum_i w_{gi,t} \,\text{SNP}_i,
\]
where $w_{gi,t}$ are eQTL-derived weights from GTEx or similar resources.  
For SiXcan, gene-level association is estimated as:
\[
Z_{g,t} \propto \frac{\sum_i w_{gi,t}\hat{\beta}_i}{\sqrt{\sum_i w_{gi,t}^2 \hat{\sigma}_i^2}}.
\]

These features are biologically meaningful inputs for downstream network models.

\section{Network Embedding and Dynamics}
Genes are embedded in pathway networks $\mathcal{G}=(V,E)$ (STRING, Reactome). Node features include $\hat{E}_{g,t}$ and $Z_{g,t}$. Dynamics are modeled using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for nonlinear pathway propagation.
    \item Neural ODEs solved with RK4 (NODE-RK4) for concentration trajectories $x(t)$.
    \item Koopman operators for stable, long-horizon disease forecasts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hybrid Interpretability Layer $\Psi(x)$}
We apply a meta-optimization equation to calibrate confidence:
\[
\Psi = \left(\alpha S + (1-\alpha)N\right)\cdot \exp\left(-[\lambda_1 R_a + \lambda_2 R_v]\right)\cdot \min\{\beta P(H|E),1\},
\]
where $\alpha$ tunes symbolic vs. neural weight, $R_a,R_v$ are authority and verifiability penalties, and $\beta$ scales posterior uplift. This ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Monotonic confidence promotion with canonical evidence.
    \item Penalty-bounded scores in $(0,1]$.
    \item Capped posterior to prevent runaway certainty.
\end{itemize}

\section{Confidence Trail and Auditability}
Each computational step is logged with parameters $(\alpha, S, N, R_a, R_v, \beta, P(H|E))$. Example:

\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
Step & Source & Key Inputs & $\Psi$ \\
\midrule
iXcan/SiXcan & Canonical & GTEx weights & 0.56 \\
Association & Expert & $\beta_{g,t}$ estimates & 0.37 \\
Network Embed & Canonical+Expert & STRING v11.5 edges & 0.41 \\
Dynamics & Neural & NODE-RK4 ODE & 0.39 \\
$\Psi$ Layer & Hybrid & $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ calibrated & 0.42 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

This provenance log is versioned and packaged as part of reproducibility artifacts.

\section{The Pre-Weighting Challenge}
iXcan/SiXcan models rely on pretrained GTEx-derived weights, which can embed biases (ancestry, age, tissue composition). To address this:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Detect divergence $D(\text{cohort}_{prod}\parallel \text{cohort}_{GTEx})$.
    \item Dynamically reweight priors: $\alpha \mapsto \alpha - \kappa D$.
    \item Update $w_{gi,t}\mapsto \tilde{w}_{gi,t}$ under new canonical datasets.
\end{enumerate}
This prevents overfitting to legacy priors while retaining auditability.

\section{Post-Quantum Provenance for FDA/EMA}
To satisfy regulatory demands, we replace brittle commit hashes and seeds with post-quantum (PQ) cryptographic attestations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dilithium3 signatures for manifests (kp-sig).
    \item SHA3-256 for artifact hashing (kp-hash).
    \item Kyber1024 for seed and secret encapsulation (kp-kem).
    \item In-toto/SLSA provenance signed under PQ keys.
\end{itemize}
This ensures artifacts are auditable, reproducible, and resilient to future cryptographic threats.

\section{Use Cases}
\subsection{Drug Concentration In Vivo}
Cyclosporine clearance trajectories predicted by SiXcan (liver tissue) $\rightarrow$ CYP3A4/5, ABCB1 expression $\rightarrow$ NODE-RK4 simulator $\rightarrow$ dosing predictions, audited for FDA/EMA.

\subsection{Disease Progression (Oncology, Alzheimer’s)}
Patient-level networks with SiXcan features, simulated with Koopman operators, yield long-term trajectories with full variant $\rightarrow$ expression $\rightarrow$ pathway logs.

\subsection{Synthetic Biology Design}
CRISPR-based perturbations simulated for yield optimization. $\Psi(x)$ constraints enforce conservation and feasibility, with confidence caps for regulatory acceptance.

\section{Conclusion}
The integration of iXcan/SiXcan with network simulation and the $\Psi(x)$ hybrid layer delivers actionable, auditable, and reproducible predictions. By addressing the pre-weighting challenge and embedding PQ-secure provenance, this framework supports enterprise deployment and regulatory filings while advancing precision medicine, R\&D, and synthetic biology.
