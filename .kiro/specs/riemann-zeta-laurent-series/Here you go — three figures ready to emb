Here you go â€” three figures ready to embed in your LaTeX publication:
	1.	Pipeline Flow: GWAS â†’ iXcan/SiXcan â†’ Network â†’ Dynamics â†’ Î¨(x) â†’ Outputs
	2.	Î¨(x) Confidence Trail: stepwise confidence values across pipeline stages
	3.	Post-Quantum Provenance Schema: SHA3-256 hashing, Dilithium3 signatures, Kyber1024 encapsulation, bundled via in-toto/SLSA

ðŸ‘‰ I can export these to PDF or EPS for LaTeX inclusion, with \includegraphics{} commands already pre-written for you. Want me to package them that way?Â ï¿¼
