üìë Enterprise Pitch Deck: Network Models Enhanced by Genetic Data

‚∏ª

1. Title Slide

‚ÄúFrom GWAS to Actionable Insight: Network Models Enhanced by Genetic Data‚Äù
Subtitle: Precision Predictions for Drug Response, Risk Stratification, and R&D Acceleration
	‚Ä¢	Logo / Branding
	‚Ä¢	Presenter (Ryan David Oates, etc.)

‚∏ª

2. Executive Summary
	‚Ä¢	The Problem: GWAS provides associations, not actionable insights.
	‚Ä¢	The Solution: PrediXcan/S-PrediXcan + Network Models turn SNP data into tissue-specific gene expression, then embed into biological networks for predictive modeling.
	‚Ä¢	Value: High-accuracy predictions for drug metabolism, disease risk, and biomarker trajectories.
	‚Ä¢	Enterprise Fit: Drop-in pipeline, scalable on cloud/HPC, auditable for compliance.

‚∏ª

3. Market Opportunity
	‚Ä¢	Pharma & Biotech: $100B+ annual spend on R&D; ~80% of leads fail late-stage due to poor target selection.
	‚Ä¢	Healthcare Systems: Precision dosing reduces adverse drug events (costing U.S. $30B annually).
	‚Ä¢	Synthetic Biology / Biomanufacturing: Optimize yields via predictive genetic network simulations.
	‚Ä¢	TAM ‚Üí SAM ‚Üí SOM slide (illustrating scalable opportunity).

4. Technology Overview

Pipeline Diagram:
	1.	Input: GWAS genotype / summary data.
	2.	PrediXcan/S-PrediXcan: Predict tissue-specific expression levels.
	3.	Network Embedding: STRING/Reactome/BioGRID pathways.
	4.	Neural Layer (GNN / NODE-RK4 / Koopman Operator): Predict downstream concentrations, risks, or trajectories.
	5.	Output: Clinically and biologically interpretable predictions.

5. Use Case 1: Precision Medicine
	‚Ä¢	Patient SNPs ‚Üí predicted liver CYP3A5/4 expression.
	‚Ä¢	Predicted clearance ‚Üí personalized cyclosporine dosing.
	‚Ä¢	Impact: fewer transplant rejection events, reduced toxicity.

ROI Example: 10‚Äì20% reduction in adverse drug events saves millions per year for large hospital systems.

‚∏ª

6. Use Case 2: Pharma R&D Acceleration
	‚Ä¢	GWAS catalog hits ‚Üí PrediXcan gene expression ‚Üí pathway embedding.
	‚Ä¢	Rank candidate targets by tissue-specific mechanistic plausibility.
	‚Ä¢	Reduces late-stage attrition, saving $50M+ per failed trial avoided.

‚∏ª

7. Use Case 3: Synthetic Biology
	‚Ä¢	Predict metabolite concentrations under CRISPR edits.
	‚Ä¢	Optimize pathway interventions before wet-lab experiments.
	‚Ä¢	Example: increasing biofuel yields by simulating enzyme overexpression.

‚∏ª

8. Differentiation
	‚Ä¢	Existing approaches: Polygenic risk scores (PRS) = black-box, weak mechanistic link.
	‚Ä¢	Our approach: PrediXcan-based expression + network physics constraints = interpretable, auditable, actionable.
	‚Ä¢	Hybrid symbolic‚Äìneural backbone (Œ®(x) meta-optimization) ensures transparent uplift without overconfidence.

‚∏ª

9. Integration & Infrastructure
	‚Ä¢	Cloud ready: Deployable on AWS/GCP/Azure clusters.
	‚Ä¢	Dockerized pipelines: From summary GWAS ‚Üí predictions in hours, not weeks.
	‚Ä¢	API layer: Plug into EMRs, drug discovery platforms, or synthetic biology design tools.
	‚Ä¢	Regulatory fit: Traceable data provenance (GWAS + GTEx ‚Üí documented pipeline).

‚∏ª

10. ROI & Business Model
	‚Ä¢	SaaS subscription for hospital systems / biotechs.
	‚Ä¢	Enterprise licensing for pharma (per indication or per dataset).
	‚Ä¢	White-label pipeline for genomics CROs.
	‚Ä¢	ROI case study: 2√ó faster target validation ‚Üí 30‚Äì50% cost savings.

‚∏ª

11. Roadmap

Phase 1: GWAS ‚Üí PrediXcan pipeline integration (6 months).
Phase 2: Network-enhanced models (GNN/NODE-RK4).
Phase 3: Enterprise deployment pilots (pharma + healthcare).
Phase 4: Scale into synthetic biology and multi-omics integration.

üí° I can also generate a PowerPoint (PPTX) or PDF deck with this skeleton formatted into slides (with placeholders for visuals like pipeline diagrams and ROI charts).

Do you want me to spin this into a slide deck file you can directly open and refine?
