## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive Riemann zeta function Laurent series calculator that computes the expansion of ζ(s) around s = 1. The system will calculate the Laurent series expansion using the Euler-Mascheroni constant and Stieltjes constants, providing both symbolic and numerical representations of the series terms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mathematician, I want to compute the Laurent series expansion of the Riemann zeta function around s = 1, so that I can analyze the behavior of ζ(s) near its pole.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a complex number s near 1 THEN the system SHALL compute ζ(s) = 1/(s-1) + γ + ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n γ_n (s-1)^n / n!
2. WHEN I specify the number of terms THEN the system SHALL include up to that many Stieltjes constants in the expansion
3. WHEN the computation is complete THEN the system SHALL return both the numerical result and the symbolic representation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to access individual components of the Laurent series (principal part, constant term, higher-order terms), so that I can analyze each contribution separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request the principal part THEN the system SHALL return 1/(s-1)
2. WHEN I request the constant term THEN the system SHALL return the Euler-Mascheroni constant γ ≈ 0.57721
3. WHEN I request higher-order terms THEN the system SHALL return each term (-1)^n γ_n (s-1)^n / n! individually
4. WHEN I request Stieltjes constants THEN the system SHALL provide γ_n values with their computed or tabulated values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a numerical analyst, I want to control the precision and convergence of the series expansion, so that I can balance accuracy with computational efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify a precision tolerance THEN the system SHALL compute terms until the contribution is below the tolerance
2. WHEN I set a maximum number of terms THEN the system SHALL not exceed this limit regardless of convergence
3. WHEN the series converges THEN the system SHALL report the number of terms used and the estimated error
4. WHEN convergence is slow THEN the system SHALL provide warnings about potential accuracy issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to visualize the step-by-step expansion process, so that I can demonstrate how each term contributes to the final result.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enable step-by-step mode THEN the system SHALL show the computation of each term separately
2. WHEN displaying terms THEN the system SHALL show both the symbolic form and numerical value
3. WHEN I request partial sums THEN the system SHALL show how the approximation improves with each additional term
4. WHEN visualizing convergence THEN the system SHALL plot the partial sums approaching the true value

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a computational mathematician, I want to validate the implementation against known values and properties, so that I can ensure the accuracy of the calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I test with s = 1.1 THEN the system SHALL produce results consistent with published zeta function values
2. WHEN I compare with direct zeta function computation THEN the Laurent series result SHALL match within specified tolerance
3. WHEN I test edge cases near s = 1 THEN the system SHALL handle numerical stability appropriately
4. WHEN I verify Stieltjes constants THEN the system SHALL use accurate tabulated or computed values

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the Laurent series calculator with other mathematical frameworks, so that I can use it as part of larger computational systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the API programmatically THEN the system SHALL provide clean interfaces for different programming languages
2. WHEN I need batch processing THEN the system SHALL efficiently handle multiple s values
3. WHEN integrating with symbolic math systems THEN the system SHALL export symbolic expressions
4. WHEN used in numerical pipelines THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate data structures for further computation
