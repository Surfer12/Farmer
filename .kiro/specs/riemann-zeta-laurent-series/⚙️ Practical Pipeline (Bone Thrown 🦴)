‚öôÔ∏è Practical Pipeline (Bone Thrown ü¶¥)
	1.	Download weights:
	‚Ä¢	GTEx-trained SNP ‚Üí expression weight files (provided by PrediXcan team).
	‚Ä¢	Tissue-specific models available: liver, kidney, brain, etc.
	2.	Run PrediXcan:
	‚Ä¢	Input: GWAS genotype data (or summary stats for S-PrediXcan).
	‚Ä¢	Output: predicted gene expression associations with phenotype.
	3.	Aggregate results:
	‚Ä¢	Create a gene-level effect vector \vec{E}_t for each tissue.
	4.	Embed into network model:
	‚Ä¢	Use STRING or Reactome pathway graph as structure.
	‚Ä¢	Initialize node embeddings with \vec{E}_t.
	‚Ä¢	Run GNN / NODE-RK4 / Koopman-based simulator to predict downstream metabolite concentrations or risk scores.
