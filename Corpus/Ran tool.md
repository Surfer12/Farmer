Quick status: Tackled top High Priority items. Implemented proper log-priors and added a minimal MCMC (Metropolis-Hastings) prototype to unblock inference work; TODO updated earlier remains valid.

### What I just added
- Log-priors (Beta, LogNormal)
  - `qualia.Stats`: `logGamma`, `logBeta`, `logBetaPdf`, `logLogNormalPdf`.
  - `HierarchicalBayesianModel.logPriors(...)`: now returns sum of Beta priors for `S`, `N`, `alpha` and LogNormal for `beta`.
- Minimal MCMC scaffold
  - `HierarchicalBayesianModel.performInference(...)`: random-walk Metropolis-Hastings with burn-in and thinning; dependency-free baseline for testing and demos.

- Implemented `qualia.Stats` and wired log-priors into `HierarchicalBayesianModel`.
- Replaced inference placeholder with a working MH sampler for initial experimentation.
- Lint is green; no API breaks.

Quick status: Updating `Corpus/qualia/TODO.md` to mark JavaDoc as complete and add a couple of completed items for package consolidation and legacy cleanup. Then I’ll re-open the file to confirm changes.

- Marked “JavaDoc for all public APIs” as complete in `Corpus/qualia/TODO.md`.
- Added completed items: package consolidation and legacy cleanup, and detailed JavaDoc.
- Verified the TODO updates in place.

Reviewing current Java files in `Corpus/qualia` and adding comprehensive JavaDoc across each public type and member, including class purpose, thread-safety, parameter/return semantics, invariants, and usage notes. Then I’ll run a lint check to catch any doc formatting or import issues.

Adding comprehensive JavaDoc across all `qualia` Java files: documenting classes, methods, record components, thread-safety, parameters/returns, invariants, and usage notes. Then I’ll run lints.

Quick status: Added comprehensive JavaDoc across `qualia` classes/interfaces and tightened docs on behavior, invariants, thread-safety, params/returns, and usage. Lint passes clean.

### Updated files (JavaDoc highlights)
- `qualia.AuditOptions`
  - Class-level: immutability, builder semantics, thread-safety.
  - Methods: `idempotencyKey()`, `dryRun()`, builder setters with param docs.
- `qualia.AuditRecord`
  - Class-level: immutability requirements, defensive copies.
  - Methods: `id()`, `timestamp()` with invariants.
- `qualia.AuditRecordImpl`
  - Class-level: thread-safety and defensive copying.
  - Constructor and `toString()` docs.
- `qualia.AuditSink`
  - Class-level: async semantics, non-blocking guidance.
  - Methods: `write(...)` params/returns, `noop()`, `composite(...)` behavior.
- `qualia.ConsoleAuditSink`
  - Class-level: dev use, non-blocking print.
  - Constructor and `write(...)` details.
- `qualia.FileAuditSink`
  - Class-level: JSONL format, rotation policy, thread-safety.
  - Constructor parameters, `rotate()`, `closeQuietly()`, `writeLine()`, and JSON serialization docs.
- `qualia.HttpAuditSink`
  - Class-level: async POST, retry/backoff behavior.
  - Constructor params, `sendWithRetry(...)`, backoff and delay helpers, serialization docs.
- `qualia.JsonUtil`
  - Class-level: scope, thread-safety.
  - `escape(...)` and `toIso8601(...)` docs.
- `qualia.ModelParameters`
  - Class-level: invariants S,N,α∈[0,1]; β>0.
- `qualia.ModelPriors`
  - Class-level: role of hyperparameters.
  - `defaults()` docs.
- `qualia.HB`
  - Class-level: placeholder/shim note directing to real classes.
- `qualia.HierarchicalBayesianModel`
  - Class-level: full Ψ structure, thread-safety.
  - Docs for `calculatePsi`, `logLikelihood`, `totalLogLikelihood`, `logPriors`, `logPosterior`, `performInference`.

- Added detailed JavaDoc across all `qualia` Java files.
- Ensured thread-safety and invariants are documented; async behavior clarified for sinks.
- Lint is green.
