### Hyper-Meta Ruleset: Synthesizing User–External Citations within the Unified Onto-Phenomenological Framework (UPOF) and an IMO 2025 Analogy

#### Objectives
- Anchor citation practice in a principled, auditable framework that balances endogenous (user-authored) and exogenous (external) evidence.
- Operationalize the core field equation Ψ(x) to regulate bias, efficiency, and reliability in real time.
- Provide deductive guarantees (proof logic), stochastic robustness (noise-aware), and topological coherence (path-stable outcomes).
- Offer an implementable scoring-and-decision pipeline with interpretable rationale.

---

### 1) Foundations and Roles

- **Endogenous signal S(x)**: Propositions originating from the user’s work (claims, definitions, results, constructions).
- **Exogenous signal N(x)**: Propositions from external, independently verifiable sources (official pages, registries, peer-reviewed articles, canonical repos).
- **Allocation α(t)∈[0,1]**: Time-varying weight privileging S vs N based on phase (preprint/live/post), evidence sufficiency, and bias control.
- **Regularizers R_cognitive, R_efficiency**: Penalize epistemic misalignment (e.g., overreach, insufficient grounding) and process overhead (e.g., excessive citation bloat).
- **Posterior factor P(H|E,β)**: Probability a given claim is accurate under current evidence E with bias parameter β correcting self-promotion risk.

Decision utility is governed by:
Ψ(x) = ∫ [α(t) S(x) + (1−α(t)) N(x)] · exp(−[λ1 R_cognitive + λ2 R_efficiency]) · P(H|E,β) dt.

Interpretation: α(t) decreases as independent, higher-authority evidence accumulates; regularizers suppress epistemic inflation; P(H|E,β) calibrates the net trust.

### 2) Hyper-Metric and Cross-Modal Asymmetry

- Define hyper-distance between memory/evidence states m'':
d''_MC = w''_t||Δt||² + w''_c d''_c(m''_1,m''_2)² + w''_e||Δe||² + w''_α||Δα||² + w''_cross∫[S''(m_1'')N''(m_2'') − S''(m_2'')N''(m_1'')]dt + σ·𝓝(0,1).

- Proof logic:
  - Metric core (time, content, emotion, allocation) preserves triangle inequality; cross-term encodes non-commutativity (order of consuming S then N ≠ N then S).
  - σ·𝓝(0,1) models stochastic self-promotion volatility; expectations E[d''] remain bounded under finite σ².

- Policy: Enforce evidence order N→S for primitives, S→N for interpretations, to minimize anchoring from speculation and preserve non-commutative stability.

---

### 3) Polytopological Coherence Axioms

- A1'' Hyper-homotopy invariance: Any two high-authority paths ending in the same primitive set are deformable without changing core conclusions; prevents reordering artifacts from flipping facts.
- A2'' Polytopic covering: Official/canonical sources cover derivative narratives; local neighborhoods (press, explainers) map homeomorphically if no new primitives are introduced.
- A3'' Monotone refinement: Adding corroborating high-authority evidence can only increase or maintain confidence in primitives; speculative additions cannot raise primitive confidence without independent artifacts.

Deduction: Citation 0–class sources (official/canonical) remain stable anchors under graph perturbations.

---

### 4) Stochastic Variational Control

- Energy functional:
𝔼''[Ψ''] = ∬ (||∂Ψ''/∂t||² + λ''||∇_{m''}Ψ''||² + μ''||∇_{s''}Ψ''||² + ν''||ξ||²) dm'' ds''.
- Stationarity (Euler–Lagrange): Optimal citation assignments minimize rapid re-ranking (temporal smoothness), avoid sharp authority discontinuities, and suppress noise-driven flips.

Operational result: Damp reactivity; allow fast upgrades only on canonical artifacts (e.g., signed releases, DOIs, official livestreams).

---

### 5) Reliability and Relevance Scoring

- Score s(c) = w_rec·Recency + w_auth·Authority + w_ver·Verifiability + w_align·Intent + w_depth·Depth − w_noise·Noise.
- Defaults: w_auth,w_ver > w_align > w_depth; w_rec elevated only during live windows; w_noise strictly penalizes hedges/rumors.

- Reliability(c) ≈ P(Claim|c) calibrated via historical Brier/log scores; adjust β to downweight self-preferential inflation.

- Decision rules:
  - Primitives: choose argmax s(c) from canonical/official strata; if user is first-party issuer, user’s artifact is canonical when it is the official channel.
  - Interpretations: require Reliability ≥ τ and at least one independent N(x) artifact; present S(x) as “Interpretation,” not “Primitive.”

---

### 6) Conflict Resolution Algorithm

1) Classify claim: Primitive vs Interpretation.  
2) Rank sources by s(c) within strata: Official/canonical → Registries/peer-review → Tier‑1 → Expert explainers → Community/social.  
3) Coherence checks:  
   - String coherence (low edit distance to canonical phrasing),  
   - Timestamp coherence (|Δt| ≤ τ window),  
   - Asset coherence (identical artifacts, hashes/URLs).  
4) If conflict persists: choose higher Authority×Verifiability for primitives; for interpretations, prefer method-transparent analyses.  
5) Record rationale (features/weights), store source graph for audit.

Proof sketch: Under monotone weights and A1''–A3'', the argmax for primitives remains at canonical nodes unless direct contradiction plus higher verifiability emerges.

---

### 7) Bayesian Hyper-Bias Correction

- Posterior synthesis with dependency control:
P(F|E_all) ∝ P(E_official|F)π_official + ∑j P(E_j|F, E_official)π_j.
- Avoid double-counting derivatives of the same artifact; shrink β for self-authored summaries that lack new evidence; expand β for independently replicated results.

- Guarantee: With strongly observed canonical evidence, posterior mass concentrates at primitives; speculative chains cannot dominate without artifact innovation.

### 8) IMO 2025 Prism: Keystone Reflections

- Analogy library:
  - P1 combinatorial line arrangements → Path multiplicity; homotopy ensures distinct search paths yield identical primitive endpoints.
  - P3 “bonza” bounds → Ethical bound constraints on self-citation; set maximum self-weight without corroboration (e.g., α_max for primitives).
  - P5 inequality games → Non-commutative updates; order-sensitive strategy minimizing regret (consume N before S for primitives).
  - P6 grid tilings → Covering maps; derivative narratives tile the plane of explanations under a canonical covering.

- Takeaway: The framework ensures that multiple reasoning trajectories (like multiple combinatorial constructions) converge to the same primitive truth set under coherence and bounds.

---

### 9) Live/Chaotic Regime: RK4 and BNSL Intuitions

- Discretize timeline (pre→live→post) and integrate updates akin to RK4: anchor steps at canonical nodes; incorporate secondary detail as slope refinements; maintain small step size during high volatility.
- BNSL lens: Expect non-monotonic gains in validity with additional sources; apply smooth-break penalties to prevent overfitting to hype spikes.

Stability policy: Never allow Recency to outrank Authority+Verifiability for primitives; post-event, decay Recency and elevate Depth.

---

### 10) Implementation Blueprint

- Evidence order: Official/canonical → User (if first-party or interpretive) → Registries/peer-review → Tier‑1 → Expert explainers → Community/social.
- α(t) policy:
  - Primitives: start with α_low (favor N); increase α only if user is canonical issuer or if S contains signed artifacts.
  - Interpretations: moderate α; require at least one N corroboration before promotion.
- Penalties:
  - R_cognitive: + when self-claims outpace artifacts; − when aligned with canonical assets.
  - R_efficiency: + for redundant, low-value citations; − for concise, high-yield references.
- Outputs per citation:
  - Role label: [Primitive]/[Interpretation]/[Context]/[Speculative].
  - Score breakdown s(c).
  - Confidence band from P(H|E,β).
  - Rationale snippet (features that determined ranking).

### 11) Numerical Illustration (concise)

- Suppose S(x)=0.60 (self precision), N(x)=0.95 (external), α=0.25 (external-favoring), R_cognitive=0.25, R_efficiency=0.10, λ1=0.85, λ2=0.15, P(H|E)=0.80, β=1.20.  
- exp penalty: exp(−[0.85·0.25 + 0.15·0.10]) ≈ exp(−0.2275) ≈ 0.7965.  
- Hybrid: 0.25·0.60 + 0.75·0.95 = 0.8625.  
- Posterior: 0.80·1.20 = 0.96 (capped).  
- Ψ(x) ≈ 0.8625·0.7965·0.96 ≈ 0.659 → elevated integrity with external anchoring, mild self-penalty.

Policy implication: Keep α small for primitives; promote only when S supplies canonical artifacts.

---

### 12) Safeguards and Limits

- Caps: For primitives without independent artifacts, enforce α ≤ α_cap (e.g., 0.3); lift cap only if user is the canonical issuer.
- Versioning: Cite exact versions (DOIs, commit hashes); label preprint vs camera-ready vs errata.
- Echo control: Cluster equivalent reposts; pick a single representative (highest Authority×Depth).
- Ambiguity: Present plural high-authority contradictions side-by-side; defer conclusion; log rationale.

---

### 13) Minimal Proof Set (sanity)

- Entropy minimization: Official/canonical reduces H(F) for primitives; any reweighting that demotes canonical in favor of derivative, lower-verifiability sources increases entropy—disallowed by objective.
- Stability lemma: Small paraphrase/timestamp perturbations do not change the argmax when Authority×Verifiability dominate—guarantees ranking robustness.
- Monotone refinement: Adding credible corroboration cannot decrease primitive confidence (A3''); speculative additions cannot increase it without artifacts—prevents echo inflation.

---

### 14) What This Achieves

- Bridges self-knowledge and external verification under a single, tunable field Ψ(x).
- Encodes non-commutative reading order to neutralize anchoring bias.
- Provides an auditable, quantitative rationale for every citation decision.
- Scales from live, chaotic events to stable archival contexts with principled dynamics.

- Implement as a deterministic pipeline with calibrated weights, explicit ordering, and persistent audit trails; expose labels, confidence, and rationale to users for transparency.
