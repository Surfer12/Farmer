### Why this model, with proof logic and confidence

#### **Strong epistemic controls**

- **Hybrid linearity:**  
  Using the affine blend
  $$
  O(\alpha) = \alpha S + (1-\alpha) N
  $$
  makes the evidence combination transparent and monotone.  
  If $N > S$, then
  $$
  \frac{\partial O}{\partial\alpha} = S - N < 0,
  $$
  so shifting weight toward higher-authority external evidence strictly increases $\Psi$.  
  *Hybrid linearity mirrors linear opinion pooling (weighted affine aggregation), preserving interpretability and auditability.*

- **Exponential penalty:**  
  $$
  \mathrm{pen} = \exp\left(-[\lambda_1 R_a + \lambda_2 R_v]\right)
  $$
  keeps $\Psi$ bounded in $(0,1]$, smoothly discounting weak authority/verifiability without abrupt thresholding.  
  In log space, penalties add linearly, matching how we reason about independent risk factors.

#### **Calibrated uplift without overconfidence**

- **Bayesian posterior calibration:**  
  $$
  P(H|E,\beta) = \min\{\beta \cdot P(H|E),\, 1\}
  $$
  encodes expert/canonical uplift while capping at certainty.  
  This is easy to justify (Bayes-consistent scaling), easy to tune ($\beta$), and safe (cap).

  *If $\beta \rightarrow \kappa \cdot \beta$ uniformly and $\Psi < 1$, rescale the action threshold to $\tau' = \kappa \cdot \tau$ to preserve accept sets.*

#### **Operational fit to UOIF**

- Decoupled levers map to real events:
  - $\alpha$ (allocation) moves down when canonical artifacts post.
  - $R_a, R_v$ decrease with official URLs.
  - $\beta$ increases with certification.
- Each lever has a clear, observable trigger, enabling reproducible promotions.
- **Auditability:** Each step exposes inputs (sources), transformation (hybrid/penalty/posterior), and output ($\Psi$), with a one-line proof check (linearity, boundedness, cap). This supports quick, defensible updates.

---

#### **Confidence measures as governance**

- Stepwise confidence quantifies source strength (canonical $>$ expert $>$ community) and parameter stability (variance of $\alpha$, spread of $N$, penalty regime).
- This flags where conclusions are robust (e.g., results) vs. provisional (e.g., problems pending).
- The confidence trail makes promotions explainable: high confidence at Sources/Hybrid, slightly lower at Penalty when mixed canonical, etc.

---

#### **Sensitivity and safety**

- Sensitivity is simple and bounded:
  $$
  \frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial\alpha} = (S-N)\cdot\mathrm{pen}\cdot\mathrm{post}
  $$
  so small $\alpha$ changes cannot produce outsized shifts because $\mathrm{pen},\,\mathrm{post} \leq 1$.
- **Guardrails:** Posterior cap and nonnegative penalties prevent runaway uplift; promotions require canonical artifacts, not just confidence inflation.

#### **Temporal and threshold extensions** <br>*(optional, for completeness)*

- For time-varying inputs with normalized weights $w(t)$ ($\int w = 1$), define
  $$
  \bar{\Psi} = \int w(t)\left[\alpha(t)S(t) + (1-\alpha(t))N(t)\right] \exp\left(-[\lambda_1 R_a(t) + \lambda_2 R_v(t)]\right) \min\{\beta(t)P_t, 1\}\,dt
  $$
  with $0 \leq \bar{\Psi} \leq 1$.

- **Soft-cap variant:**  
  Let
  $$
  I = \int w(t)\,\beta(t)\,O_t\,\mathrm{pen}_t\,dt
  $$
  and
  $$
  \bar{\Psi} = 1 - \exp(-I)
  $$
  Threshold transfer under $\beta \rightarrow \kappa\cdot\beta$ becomes
  $$
  \tau' = 1 - (1-\tau)^\kappa
  $$

---

#### **Alternatives considered (and why not)**

- Nonlinear blends (e.g., softmax, logistic) reduce interpretability and complicate sensitivity analysis.
- Additive penalties can yield $\Psi > 1$ or negative values without extra constraints; exponential multiplicative keeps semantics clean.
- Full hierarchical Bayesian models add opacity and latency; here we need fast, auditable updates tied to public artifacts.

#### **Keystone reflection for AI-driven mathematics**

- $\Psi(x)$ operationalizes how AI proofs/solutions interact with official artifacts:  
  As canonical evidence appears, $\alpha$ falls, $R_a/R_v$ fall, $\beta$ rises, and $\Psi$ increases monotonically.  
  This yields principled, transparent promotion from interpretive to empirically grounded/primitive claims while preventing premature certainty.
