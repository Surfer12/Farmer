Searching for IMO updates
I’m looking into the instructions that say I should keep going until the user’s query is fully resolved. The user wants me to check for official IMO links once they're published. It's probable that the 2024 solutions are posted, but by August 8, 2025, the official pages should be available. I’ll need to use the web search tool to confirm these links and update the relevant pipeline for the official Problem and Solutions pages.
Verifying calculations
I need to ensure that the calculations for Ψ(x) match what the user provided. They calculated O_hybrid as 0.180.60 + 0.820.92, resulting in 0.8624, which they wrote as 0.864 (close). Then, I’ll compute Ψ(x) using their values. For the multiplication and penalty factors, they mentioned P(H|E) as 0.90 and β as 1.08, which aligns with their final figure. It all seems plausible, including the calculations for 2024, leading me to conclude they are consistent.Updating user on IMO links
The user hasn't asked a specific question but shared an update, so it’s my job to verify and add the official links as outlined in their "Next actions." I can propose adjustments to parameters like α(primitives), N(x), and β if those pages are available. I’ll use the web search tool to find official IMO pages for 2025 and 2024, as noted by the user. I'll make sure to provide a concise status update and include markdown links in my summary.
Planning updates for Psi calculations
The instructions suggest using web search for the most current information, so I’ll start there. I’m considering whether to propose storing memory or creating a Notion document, but it doesn’t seem essential right now. The user wants to reduce α(primitives), set N(x), and β to new values. I'll propose α(primitives) as 0.12 for comparability, set N(x) to 0.97, and keep P(H|E) at 0.90. I might adjust the penalty if there are official postings, but I’ll maintain it as is for now.
Calculating O_hybrid and adjustments
I’m computing O_hybrid as 0.120.60 + 0.880.97, which gives me 0.9256, and factoring in the penalty of 0.7965. I notice that the Beta factor, calculated at 1.035, needs to be capped at 1.0. The resulting Ψ is 0.7371, which is below the expected threshold of >0.75. To possibly improve that, I might consider lowering α to 0.10 and adjusting N(x) while keeping the penalty as is. I think adjustments based on cognitive risk could be beneficial too, but first,

I’m going to check whether the official IMO 2025 pages (problems/results) are live so we can add links and, if so, recompute Ψ(x) with your proposed parameter updates.
