Creating new non-blocking audit sinks: a JSON-lines file sink with size/time rotation and an HTTP sink with retry/backoff. Also resolving duplicate audit type definitions by introducing `AuditRecord.java`, adding a separate `ConsoleAuditSink.java`, and removing the conflicting `core.java`. Then I'll add a small JSON utility used by both sinks.

Planning to: 1) delete `Corpus/qualia/core.java` to remove duplicate audit type definitions, 2) adjust `FileAuditSink` to use a bounded platform-thread executor (safer than virtual threads for a worker pool), 3) adjust `HttpAuditSink` to use `CompletableFuture.delayedExecutor` for backoff, and 4) update `TODO.md` checkboxes for the two sinks and serialization. Proceeding to read current files and then apply edits.

Updating packages to `qualia` for model classes and cleaning unused imports to resolve linter errors. Then Iâ€™ll re-run lint checks.

Quick status: Implemented the initial persistent audit sinks and cleaned up the audit API. Removed the legacy aggregator to avoid duplicates, unified packages under `qualia`, and added a minimal JSON utility. Updated `TODO.md` to reflect progress.

### What I built
- File sink (JSON Lines) with rotation
  - `qualia.FileAuditSink`: writes one JSON object per line; rotates by size or time; non-blocking via a small bounded executor.
- HTTP sink (POST + retry/backoff)
  - `qualia.HttpAuditSink`: async `HttpClient`, exponential backoff with a cap, uses `CompletableFuture.delayedExecutor`.
- Console sink separated
  - `qualia.ConsoleAuditSink`: retains dev-friendly behavior; non-blocking.
- Shared utilities and interfaces
  - `qualia.AuditRecord` (interface) and `qualia.AuditRecordImpl` (existing).
  - `qualia.JsonUtil` for escaping and ISO-8601 timestamps.
  - Removed `Corpus/qualia/core.java` (duplicate/legacy audit bundle).
- Package consistency
  - Moved `HierarchicalBayesianModel`, `ModelParameters`, `ModelPriors`, and `HB` to package `qualia`.

### Files added/edited (highlights)
- Added: `qualia/AuditRecord.java`, `qualia/ConsoleAuditSink.java`, `qualia/FileAuditSink.java`, `qualia/HttpAuditSink.java`, `qualia/JsonUtil.java`
- Edited: `qualia/HierarchicalBayesianModel.java`, `qualia/ModelParameters.java`, `qualia/ModelPriors.java`, `qualia/HB.java`
- Removed: `qualia/core.java` (eliminated duplicates)
- Updated: `Corpus/qualia/TODO.md` to check off file sink, HTTP sink, and serialization.

### How to use (minimal examples)
- File sink:
  ```java
  AuditSink sink = new FileAuditSink(new File("logs/audit"), "audit", 10_000_000, 3_600_000, 1024);
  sink.write(new AuditRecordImpl("id-1", new Date()), AuditOptions.builder().dryRun(false).build());
  ```
- HTTP sink:
  ```java
  AuditSink sink = new HttpAuditSink(URI.create("https://example.com/audit"), 5, Duration.ofMillis(200));
  sink.write(new AuditRecordImpl("id-2", new Date()), AuditOptions.builder().dryRun(false).build());
  ```

- `TODO.md` changes:
  - File-based sink: done
  - HTTP sink: done (with retry/backoff)
  - Serialization: done (JSON Lines)

- Implemented `qualia.FileAuditSink` (JSONL + rotation), `qualia.HttpAuditSink` (async + retry/backoff), and `qualia.ConsoleAuditSink`.
- Added `qualia.AuditRecord` and `qualia.JsonUtil`. Removed `qualia/core.java`. Unified packages to `qualia`.
- Updated `Corpus/qualia/TODO.md` to mark sinks and serialization complete.
