Drafting LaTeX Document
I need to draft a LaTeX document for theorems 1 and 2, including an explanation of all notation and providing confidence steps and scores for each proof step. The user hasn’t specifically asked for file edits and just wants content, yet the developer instructions suggest I should use tools for editing. They have some files that imply they could want a .tex file, but I think providing the LaTeX content as a code block will be sufficient for now.

Drafting LaTeX Content
The developer guideline suggests not to output code unless the user requests it. However, since the user specifically asked to draft LaTeX document content, I'm allowed to include a code block. I could create a file in their workspace, but they didn't ask for that directly. It might be wise to ask if they'd like it saved. Still, I’ll go ahead and provide the LaTeX content in a fenced code block, including all necessary elements like notation explanations, Theorems 1 and 2, proofs, and the confidence steps they mentioned.
Annotating Confidence Steps
The "confidence steps and scores" likely means I need to annotate each proof step with a confidence metric according to our governance model. I could create a "Confidence Annotations" environment or use footnotes for this. Each step can be labeled and assigned scores, like Step 1 with 0.95, based on canonical knowledge. Since I'm using established lemmas, the confidence is generally high, but I’ll notenote any assumption-based uniqueness claims. I’ll also include a Notation section, and although references weren't explicitly requested, I might consider adding a bibliography block for completeness, as it adds value to the document. I'll ensure to provide proper LaTeX preamble and macros for the "ConfidenceStep" environment, too.
Creating LaTeX Macros and Structure
I could define a macro to print each proof step alongside its score. I plan to include a "proof" environment using amsthm and provide definitions for Theorems and Lemmas, specifically Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, as discussed. Each step will have a confidence score with bracketed annotations, and I’ll include a score scale explanation from [0, 1]. While keeping responses concise by default, I understand the document will need to be more detailed. I’ll provide the LaTeX code in a single code block, and I'll also add a Notation section to clarify terminology. Although a status update isn’t necessary since I'm not using tools, I’ll keep this in mind for future reference.

Preparing LaTeX Document
I’m expected to provide a "status update" before delivering the code. So, I’ll add a short status line before including the LaTeX in a code block. I need to construct the LaTeX structure which will include necessary packages and define a "confstep" environment for scoring. Theorems should be clear with their proofs explained step by step, and I’ll be sure to include confidence scores for each step as well. I’ll also add sections for notation and a brief reflection at the end, as it adds depth. Let’s go ahead and draft the code!
