## How to Test the Implementation

### Prerequisites
1. **macOS 13.0+** (required by Package.swift)
2. **Swift 6.0+** or **Xcode 15.0+**

### Option 1: Swift Package Manager
```bash
# Navigate to workspace
cd /workspace

# Build the project
swift build

# Run PINN example
swift run uoif-cli pinn

# Run Ψ framework example
swift run uoif-cli psi
```

### Option 2: Xcode
1. Open `Farmer.xcodeproj`
2. Select `UOIFCLI` target
3. Set command line arguments in scheme editor:
   - For PINN: `pinn`
   - For Ψ framework: `psi`
4. Build and run (⌘+R)

### Option 3: Command Line with Xcode
```bash
# Build with Xcode
xcodebuild -project Farmer.xcodeproj -target UOIFCLI -configuration Release

# Run the built executable
./build/Release/uoif-cli pinn
```

## Expected Output

### PINN Training
```
=== Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Example ===

Generated training data:
  Spatial points (x): 41 points from -1.0 to 1.0
  Temporal points (t): 21 points from 0.0 to 1.0

Initialized PINN with Xavier initialization
  Architecture: 2 → 20 → 20 → 1
  Learning rate: 0.005
  Perturbation: 1e-5

Starting PINN training for 1000 epochs...
Epoch 0: Loss = 0.847392
Epoch 100: Loss = 0.234156
Epoch 200: Loss = 0.089234
...
Training completed!
```

### Ψ Framework Analysis
```
=== Ψ Framework Analysis Results ===
Step 1: Outputs
  S(x) = 0.72 (state inference accuracy)
  N(x) = 0.85 (ML gradient descent convergence)

Step 2: Hybrid
  α(t) = 0.50 (real-time validation balance)
  O_hybrid = (1-α)*S(x) + α*N(x) = 0.785

Step 3: Penalties
  R_cognitive = 0.15 (PDE residual error)
  R_efficiency = 0.10 (computational overhead)
  P_total = λ1*R_cognitive + λ2*R_efficiency = 0.130

Step 4: Probability
  P(H|E,β) = 0.80 (base probability)
  β = 1.2 (responsiveness factor)
  P_adj = P*β = 0.96

Step 5: Ψ(x)
  Ψ(x) = O_hybrid * exp(-P_total) * P_adj ≈ 0.662

Step 6: Interpretation
  Ψ(x) ≈ 0.66 indicates solid model performance
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Swift not found**
   - Install Swift from swift.org
   - Use Xcode command line tools
   - Check PATH environment variable

2. **Build errors**
   - Ensure macOS 13.0+ compatibility
   - Check Swift version (6.0+ required)
   - Verify all dependencies are available

3. **Runtime errors**
   - Check input data ranges
   - Verify learning rate and perturbation values
   - Monitor loss convergence during training

### Performance Optimization

1. **Training speed**
   - Reduce number of epochs for testing
   - Adjust learning rate (0.001-0.01 range)
   - Use smaller training datasets initially

2. **Memory usage**
   - Reduce hidden layer size
   - Use smaller spatial/temporal grids
   - Implement batch processing for large datasets

## Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** using one of the methods above
2. **Validate results** against expected outputs
3. **Extend functionality** with additional PDEs
4. **Optimize performance** for production use
5. **Add more visualization options** (3D plots, animations)
