Expanding on decision policy
I need to respond to the user’s "tell me more" request, as they likely want a deeper explanation of the decision policy we discussed using a math-oriented framework. Since they have a markdown file titled "### How I decide, step by step.md" open, I should provide concrete examples and a meaningful expansion. I’ll include headings, bullets as per markdown, and avoid heavy formatting while demonstrating math with a worked example and maybe a simple formula or pseudocode. Keeping it concise is key!
Detailing the decision framework
I could include elements like an "audit trail example," "parameter defaults," and "edge cases." It’s crucial to address failure modes and how they are managed, alongside what constitutes canonical, expert, and community perspectives. I should align the response with user rules, especially their model with hybrid linearity. Even without tool calls, I need to include status updates and provide a summary at the end, while keeping verbosity minimal. I’ll use concise examples and numbers to enhance clarity.
Delving into decision mechanics
I can choose to read the mentioned file to align, though it's not strictly necessary for this general question. Let’s create a structured response:
1) Discuss signal taxonomy (S, N definitions) with examples.
2) Outline parameterization rules for selecting α, mapping λ1/λ2 to source classes, and defining β selection rules.
3) Provide a worked example with numbers related to O, pen, post, and Ψ.
4) Present an action policy table mapping Ψ to actions concisely.
5) Address edge cases like conflicting sources and flaky tests.
6) Describe the audit trail for logging.
7) Conduct a sensitivity check for quick derivative computation.
8) Define promotion triggers and downgrades.
9) Specify tunable parameters for users like α min.
10) Explain fallback strategies when sources disagree.
Keeping it concise and clear is key!
Preparing to expand parameter rules
I should definitely use LaTeX for any math, and since the environment specifies "###" headings, I’ll follow that. Although we don’t have tool calls, it makes sense to provide a brief status update at the beginning. I’ll format it like this: "Expanding with concrete parameter rules, numeric examples, edge cases; no blockers."
Next, I’ll outline content with bullet points:
1) Discuss signal classes: S sources like tests and static analysis, and N sources from official documentation, including a risk scoring label. 
Keeping it concise is key!
Detailing parameter defaults and examples
I’m outlining parameter defaults starting with α, along with shifting triggers and λ1/λ2 recommendations. I’ll provide a numeric example: using S=0.62, N=0.88, and α=0.6 results in a computed outcome (O). Then I’ll show how to calculate penalties and adjusted outputs while ensuring consistency with definitions. I’ll also create a second scenario with lower α values.
I plan to cover tuning, failure modes, output actions, and the impact of alternatives concisely, followed by a brief summary in bullet points to keep it clear and straightforward!

Quick status: Expanding with concrete parameter rules, a numeric example, edge cases, and tuning knobs. No blockers.

### Deeper on how and why
- **Signal classes**
  - **S (internal)**: tests/lints/builds, static analysis, code heuristics, runtime checks.
  - **N (external/canonical)**: vendor specs, standards, official release notes, security advisories.

- **Parameterization (defaults and triggers)**
  - **α (allocation)**: start 0.6–0.7 (favor in-repo). Drop toward 0.1–0.3 when official docs/PRDs/standards appear and match context.
  - **λ1, λ2 (penalty weights)**: start λ1=λ2=1. Increase λ1 when authority is weak; increase λ2 when claims are hard to verify or versioned ambiguously.
  - **R_a, R_v (risks)**: scale in [0,1]. Official docs ~ 0.05–0.2; reputable blog ~ 0.3–0.5; anonymous forum ~ 0.5–0.8.
  - **β (uplift)**: 1.0 by default; 1.1–1.4 for certified/vendor-blessed guidance; capped by design.

- **Worked example (before/after canon)**
  - Inputs: S=0.60, N=0.90, λ1=0.8, λ2=1.0.
  - Case A (weak evidence): α=0.5, R_a=0.3, R_v=0.2, β=1.3.
    - O = 0.5·0.60 + 0.5·0.90 = 0.75
    - pen = exp(−(0.8·0.3 + 1.0·0.2)) = exp(−0.44) ≈ 0.644
    - P(H|E) = O·pen = 0.75·0.644 ≈ 0.483
    - post = min(β·P(H|E), 1) = min(1.3·0.483, 1) ≈ 0.628 ⇒ Ψ≈0.63 → propose minimal, ask if preference-bound.
  - Case B (official doc lands): α=0.2, R_a=0.1, R_v=0.05, β=1.3.
    - O = 0.2·0.60 + 0.8·0.90 = 0.84
    - pen = exp(−(0.8·0.1 + 1.0·0.05)) = exp(−0.13) ≈ 0.878
    - P(H|E) = 0.84·0.878 ≈ 0.737
    - post = min(1.3·0.737, 1) ≈ 0.958 ⇒ Ψ≈0.96 → safe to execute and verify.

- **Edge cases and responses**
  - **Conflicting sources (S↑, N↓ or vice versa)**: keep α mixed, increase λ where risk is higher, seek a canonical tie-breaker; avoid irreversible ops until Ψ≥0.85.
  - **Flaky tests**: S uncertainty rises; hold edits, stabilize flakiness first to lift S.
  - **Ambiguous versioning**: bump R_v; pin versions or cite exact vendor doc to reduce R_v.
  - **Long-running/interactive ops**: defer or run with dry-runs/non-interactive flags; only auto-exec when Ψ high.

- **Audit trail (what I record)**
  - Sources with URLs, α, (R_a, R_v), (λ1, λ2), β, computed (O, pen, post, Ψ), and the action gate used.

- **Sensitivity/guardrails**
  - Small α shifts have bounded effect: ∂Ψ/∂α=(S−N)·pen·post with pen,post≤1.
  - Capped posterior prevents runaway certainty; promotions require canon, not just “confidence.”

- **Tuning knobs you can set**
  - Minimum/maximum α, default λs, action thresholds, and which domains count as canonical.

- **Why this wins operationally**
  - Interpretable, fast, monotone with respect to canon; easy to audit and update when new artifacts arrive.

- Clearer parameter defaults, numeric example showing Ψ before/after canonical evidence, and how actions change.
- Edge-case handling (conflicts, flakiness, version ambiguity) and the audit/tuning knobs you can adjust.
