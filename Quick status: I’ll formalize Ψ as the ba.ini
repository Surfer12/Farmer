Quick status: I’ll formalize Ψ as the baseline policy, state preconditions for Bayes/RL/MCDA, prove each module is a monotone/constrained improvement, and conclude that composition is weakly dominating and safe. No blockers.

### Setup
- Actions A; hard constraints C⊆A (policy/compliance).
- Signals S,N∈[0,1]; α∈[0,1]; risks r=(R_a,R_v); weights λ; uplift β.
- Score Ψ(S,N,α,r,λ,β)∈[0,1]; act if Ψ≥τ and a∈C.
- Baseline policy π_Ψ selects any a maximizing expected value proxy gated by Ψ≥τ, else abstain.

### Operators and preconditions
- Rules/MCDA operator R,M:
  - Preconditions: explicit constraints/preferences exist.
  - Effect: C←C∩C_rules; α←α(w) from MCDA weights. Both are deterministic and auditably set.
- Bayes operator B:
  - Preconditions: labeled/structured evidence D with likelihood p(D|H), coherent prior.
  - Effect: replace uncalibrated score y with calibrated posterior p(H|D); order-preserving in evidence.
- RL operator L:
  - Preconditions: observable reward r_t, safe exploration budget, constraints C.
  - Effect: choose a policy maximizing expected return subject to C and Ψ-based safety gates.

### Lemma 1 (Rules/MCDA preserve feasibility and monotonicity)
Applying R shrinks A to A_R⊆A. If π_Ψ chose a∈C, then a∈A_R or is blocked (policy-compliant by construction). Updating α via M keeps O(α)=αS+(1−α)N affine and Ψ monotone/bounded. Thus safety/compliance are preserved and decisions remain auditable.

Proof sketch: Constraint intersection cannot add infeasible actions. Affine reweighting keeps ∂Ψ/∂evidence signs unchanged; boundedness holds since Ψ∈[0,1].

### Lemma 2 (Bayes calibration weakly improves decisions under proper scoring)
Given proper scoring rule L and data D, the posterior p(H|D) uniquely minimizes E[L] among all measurable predictors. Replacing y by p(H|D) cannot increase expected loss; for binary thresholding with misclassification costs, the Bayes decision (threshold at cost ratio) is risk‑optimal.

Proof sketch: Standard result for proper scoring rules; posterior is the conditional expectation/argmin of expected proper loss. Threshold optimality follows from Bayes decision theory.

### Lemma 3 (Constrained RL weakly dominates baseline on return)
Let Π be the set of policies feasible under constraints C and Ψ‑based safety gates. The RL solution π_RL∈argmax_{π∈Π} E[return]. Since π_Ψ∈Π whenever Ψ≥τ and constraints hold, E[return(π_RL)] ≥ E[return(π_Ψ)]. If preconditions fail (no reward/exploration), L reduces to identity.

Proof sketch: Direct from optimality over a superset containing π_Ψ; constraints preserve safety.

### Composition Theorem (Why compose around Ψ when preconditions hold)
Compose operators in the order R→M→Ψ‑gate→B→L. Under each module’s preconditions:
1) R,M enforce hard constraints and stakeholder preferences while preserving Ψ’s bounded monotonicity (Lemma 1).
2) B replaces the provisional score with a calibrated posterior that minimizes expected proper loss and yields Bayes‑optimal thresholds (Lemma 2).
3) L optimizes long‑run reward over the same safe, compliant feasible set, never worse than π_Ψ (Lemma 3).

Therefore, the composite policy π_comp is:
- Safe/compliant: enforced by R and Ψ gates.
- Fast/auditable: Ψ provides immediate, bounded, monotone gating; each module is transparent and monotone/contractive on risk.
- Weakly dominating: π_comp matches π_Ψ when preconditions fail (operators become identity), and otherwise improves calibration (B) and/or expected return (L) without violating constraints.

Corollary (Why “around”, not “instead of” Ψ)
- Ψ supplies immediate, monotone safety gating aligned with canon and bounded sensitivity; B and L are monotone/posterior/optimizer layers that cannot preserve safety alone. Composing around Ψ preserves its guarantees while unlocking calibration (Bayes) and learning (RL) only when their assumptions are valid.

- Defined operators and preconditions; showed R/M preserve safety/compliance and Ψ’s properties.
- Proved Bayes improves calibration and threshold decisions; RL weakly dominates on return under constraints.
- Concluded composition is safe, fast, auditable, and weakly better than Ψ alone when preconditions hold.
