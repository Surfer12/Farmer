# Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Accuracy Functional Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of the **Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Accuracy Functional** (Ψ(x)), a novel mathematical framework that combines symbolic reasoning (RK4-derived solutions) with neural network predictions for enhanced AI responsiveness and accuracy.

## Mathematical Formalization

### Core Functional

The hybrid functional is defined as:

```
Ψ(x) = (1/T) Σ[k=1 to T] [α(t_k)S(x,t_k) + (1-α(t_k))N(x,t_k)] 
       × exp(-[λ₁R_cog(t_k) + λ₂R_eff(t_k)]) × P(H|E,β,t_k)
```

### Components

- **S(x,t) ∈ [0,1]**: Symbolic accuracy (normalized RK4 solution fidelity)
- **N(x,t) ∈ [0,1]**: Neural accuracy (normalized ML/NN prediction fidelity)  
- **α(t) ∈ [0,1]**: Adaptive weight = σ(-κ·λ_local(t)), favoring neural in chaotic regions
- **R_cog(t) ≥ 0**: Cognitive penalty (physics violation, energy drift)
- **R_eff(t) ≥ 0**: Efficiency penalty (normalized FLOPs/latency)
- **λ₁, λ₂ ≥ 0**: Regularization weights (e.g., λ₁=0.75 for theoretical emphasis)
- **P(H|E,β,t) ∈ [0,1]**: Calibrated probability with bias β (Platt-scaled)

### Key Properties

- **Bounded**: Ψ(x) ∈ [0,1] through normalization and clipping
- **Interpretable**: Clear component breakdown for analysis
- **Adaptive**: Dynamic weighting based on system characteristics
- **Regularized**: Penalizes physics violations and computational inefficiency
