# Hybrid AI-Physics Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) System

A complete implementation of a hybrid model that combines physics-based interpolation with ML corrections, featuring explicit uncertainty quantification at each stage (encoding, decoding, governance).

## 🎯 Core Mathematical Framework

### Hybrid Output
```
O(α) = α S(x) + (1−α) N(x)
```
- **S(x)**: Physics-based interpolation (sigma-level dynamics)
- **N(x)**: ML correction (learned residuals with small-signal scaling)
- **α(t)**: Adaptive balancing parameter across encode/decode cycles

### Penalty System
```
pen = exp(−[λ₁ R_cognitive + λ₂ R_efficiency])
```
- **R_cognitive**: Representational fidelity (vorticity/divergence constraints)
- **R_efficiency**: Stability/efficiency trade-offs (anti-oscillation, computational budget)

### Calibrated Posterior
```
post = min{β · P(H|E), 1}
```
- **β**: Responsiveness to surface-level error evidence
- **P(H|E)**: Base probability from external evidence

### Confidence Metric
```
Ψ(x) = O(α) · pen · post ∈ [0,1]
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. Encoding Process (plane → vector/sigma space)

#### Physics Interpolation S(x)
- Surface-linear transforms and sigma-level mapping
- **Diagnostics**: 
  - Vorticity: `ζ = k̂·(∇_p × u)`
  - Divergence: `δ = ∇_p · u`
- Cached states in contiguous buffers for fast computation

#### Neural Correction N(x)
- Residual prediction with small-signal scaling: `γ ≈ 0.02·σ_surface`
- Heteroscedastic uncertainty head: `σ(x)`
- Mitigates initialization shocks and phase drift

#### Hybridization & Regularization
- **R_cognitive**: Divergence-free/rotational structure, energy consistency, phase smoothness
- **R_efficiency**: Anti-oscillation, limiter-based smoothness, runtime envelopes

### 2. Decoding Process (vector/sigma space → plane)

#### Potential Diagnosis & Backpressure
- Physically verifiable diagnosis (Eq. B4 equivalent)
- Subcap/cap balancing with `cap ≤ 1`
- Second learned correction for systematic bias from clamping

#### Reconstruction & Uncertainty Projection
- Grid-space MSE + NLL (if probabilistic)
- Propagate aleatoric σ(x) + epistemic spread
- Prediction intervals or conformal sets

### 3. Uncertainty Quantification (Embedded)

#### Aleatoric Uncertainty
```python
ℒ_NLL = ½log(2πσ²) + (y-ŷ)²/(2σ²)
```
- Heteroscedastic head with optimized NLL
- Calibrated intervals

#### Epistemic Uncertainty
- **Deep Ensemble** (n≈5) or **SWAG/Laplace** approximation
- Predictive entropy/variance gates α updates and abstentions
- OOD/instability flags near Hopf bifurcations

#### Conformal Calibration
- Split conformal residual quantiles
- Post-hoc coverage guarantees for decoded variables
- Online updates for distribution drift

## 🎛️ Governance & Risk Management

### Adaptive Parameters

#### α(t) Scheduler
```python
# Increase α when:
- Physics constraints pass consistency checks
- Epistemic uncertainty spikes (trust physics more)
- Near bifurcations or instability

# Decrease α when:
- Residuals are stable and well-calibrated
- Low epistemic uncertainty
```

#### λ Penalty Weights
```python
# Tighten when:
- Instability/oscillation indices high
- Bifurcation proximity detected

# Relax when:
- Smoothness budgets met
- Stable operation
```

#### β Responsiveness
```python
# Increase with:
- External verification (benchmarks, replications)
- Certified artifacts

# Otherwise: Conservative default
```

### Risk Gates & Safety
- **Abstention Criteria**: `bifurcation_flag OR pred_var > 3×threshold`
- **CVaR Gates**: Abstain/escalate when reconstruction error exceeds policy
- **Bounded Updates**: All sensitivities properly bounded for predictable behavior

## 📊 First-Order Sensitivities

### Safety Analysis
```python
∂Ψ/∂α = (S−N) · pen · post     # Bounded by |S−N|
∂Ψ/∂R_cog = −λ₁ O · pen · post ≤ 0  # Penalties reduce confidence
∂Ψ/∂R_eff = −λ₂ O · pen · post ≤ 0  # Penalties reduce confidence  
∂Ψ/∂β = O · pen · P(H|E)       # When βP < 1; else 0
```

**Implication**: Bounded, predictable updates with no runaway uplift because `pen ≤ 1` and `post ≤ 1`.

## 🧪 Numerical Verification

### Specification Example
```python
# Given: S=0.78, N=0.86, α=0.48
O = 0.48×0.78 + 0.52×0.86 = 0.8216

# R_cog=0.13, R_eff=0.09, λ₁=0.57, λ₂=0.43
pen = exp(−0.1128) ≈ 0.893

# P=0.80, β=1.15
post = min{1.15×0.80, 1} = 0.92

# Result: Ψ(x) ≈ 0.8216 × 0.893 × 0.92 ≈ 0.6767 ✓
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install torch numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from hybrid_uq_recipe import HybridModel, AlphaScheduler, SplitConformal

# Setup model
grid_metrics = {'dx': 1.0, 'dy': 1.0, 'in_channels': 4, 'out_channels': 4}
model = HybridModel(grid_metrics, in_ch=4, out_ch=4)
scheduler = AlphaScheduler()

# Forward pass
outputs = model(x, external_P=torch.tensor(0.8))
psi = outputs['psi']  # Confidence metric

# Adaptive governance
abstain = scheduler.step(model, pred_var, resid_stability, bifurcation_flag)

# Conformal calibration
conformal = SplitConformal(quantile=0.9)
conformal.fit(cal_preds, cal_targets)
lower, upper = conformal.intervals(test_preds)
```
