Reflection
The Ψ framework is anchored in your governance docs [GovDocs] and constrained by operational safety texts [SRE2016], [Kleppmann2017], [Nygard2018]. Its linear blend and exponential penalties reflect reliability‑style risk composition [Cox1972], [BarlowProschan1981], while thresholding and calibration come from classical decision theory and proper scoring [Berger1985], [Savage1954], [GneitingRaftery2007]. Nonlinear alternatives and belief frameworks [Bishop2006], [Goodfellow2016], [Shafer1976], [Zadeh1965] informed what to avoid by default (opacity, non‑monotone sensitivity), and where to compose when preconditions hold: MCDA/rules for stakeholder constraints [KeeneyRaiffa1993], [Saaty1980], [HwangYoon1981], and Bayes/RL for calibration/learning when labeled data or rewards exist [Platt1999], [ZadroznyElkan2002], [Guo2017], [SuttonBarto2018], [LattimoreSzepesvari2020], [Auer2002], [Achiam2017]. Net effect: a monotone, bounded, auditable core with principled extensions, matching your needs for fast, safe, reproducible decisions.
Collected full references with anchors, plus an all‑inclusive citation map.
Added a brief reflection tying each source cluster to the design of Ψ and when to compose Bayes/RL/MCDA
