## Key Mathematical Contributions

### Core Framework
```
Ψ = min{β · O(α) · pen(r), 1}
where:
- O(α) = αS + (1-α)N  (hybrid evidence blend)
- pen(r) = exp(-[λ₁R_a + λ₂R_v])  (exponential penalty)
```

### Theoretical Results
1. **Gauge Freedom Theorem**: Parameter reparameterizations preserving functional form leave Ψ unchanged
2. **Threshold Transfer Theorem**: Decision thresholds can be rescaled to preserve accept/reject sets
3. **Equivalence Theorem**: Necessary and sufficient conditions for framework equivalence
4. **Divergence Criteria**: Characterization of when frameworks are structurally different

### Empirical Validation
- **2025 Results**: Ψ = 0.831 (Empirically Grounded)
- **2025 Problems**: Ψ = 0.633 (Interpretive/Contextual) 
- **2024 Reference**: Ψ = 0.796 (Primitive/Empirically Grounded)

Dear Editor,

We submit our manuscript "The Ψ Framework: A Unified Approach to Epistemic Confidence in Decision-Making Under Uncertainty" for consideration in [JOURNAL NAME].

This work addresses a fundamental challenge in AI-assisted decision-making: how to systematically estimate confidence when combining evidence sources of varying authority and verifiability. Our Ψ framework provides a mathematically principled solution with proven theoretical properties and empirical validation.

Key contributions include:
1. Novel mathematical framework combining hybrid evidence blending, exponential risk penalties, and Bayesian calibration
2. Theoretical foundations including gauge freedom, threshold transfer, and sensitivity invariants
3. Formal equivalence and divergence criteria for confidence frameworks
4. Empirical validation using International Mathematical Olympiad problems

The work is technically sound, addresses an important problem, and provides both theoretical insights and practical utility. We believe it makes a significant contribution to the machine learning and decision theory literature.

The manuscript is approximately 8,000 words with 19 references. All authors have approved the submission and declare no conflicts of interest.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Author Name]
