Calling tools for licenses
I’m planning to use grep for various license identifiers like "CC0", "Creative Commons", "CC BY", and "LICENSE". I also want to list the directory to find any LICENSE files. My approach is to perform these tool calls in parallel by searching the Farmer directory while grepping for terms like "SPDX" and "license" as well. Using multi_tool_use.parallel should be efficient for this task!

Quick status: I’ll scan your `Farmer` directory for any mention of CC0/Creative Commons/license headers to point to where CC0 is declared. Then I’ll summarize exact file/line locations. No blockers.

Scanning your repo to verify any explicit CC0 grant. I’ll open the file that mentions CC0 and also search for SPDX CC0 identifiers or LICENSE files.

Quick status: I searched your project for any CC0 declarations (SPDX tags, LICENSE files, “Creative Commons Zero”) and found none. One note file mentions CC0 as an option, but it is not a grant.

### What I found
- No `LICENSE`, `COPYING`, or SPDX “CC0-1.0” headers.
- Only a planning note referencing CC0 (not a license grant):
```1:26:/Users/ryan_david_oates/Farmer/Sources/UOIFCore/Evaluating licensing for Ψ framework.sty
I suggest CC BY 4.0 or CC0 for no strings attached ...
Docs/specs/LaTeX: CC BY 4.0 (attribution required). If you want zero frictions, CC0.
```

### Conclusion
- There is currently no place in the repo that declares “underlying mathematical content is CC0.” If you intended CC0, it has not been published yet.

### Fastest way to make it true (pick one)
- Top‑level license (recommended):
  - Create `LICENSE` with “CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication” text from `https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode`.
- SPDX header in files that express the math (optional but nice):
  - Add to the top of `.tex`, `.md`: `%% SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0` (LaTeX) or `<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0 -->` (Markdown).
- Short notice in README (optional):
  - “Mathematical content and accompanying text are dedicated to the public domain under CC0 1.0.”

If you want, I can add the `LICENSE` file and insert SPDX headers in your key docs now.
