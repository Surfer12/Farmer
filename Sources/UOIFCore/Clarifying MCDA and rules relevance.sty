Clarifying MCDA and rules relevance
I need to explain why MCDA and rules don’t apply in this context, which involves trivial bijection, gauge freedom, sensitivity invariants, and the Psi framework. MCDA and rule engines focus on encoding stakeholder preferences for discrete choices, while the current discussion is about continuous scoring and parameter relationships. Essentially, MCDA and rules serve as constraints without altering the underlying mathematics of threshold transfer, derivative invariants, or gauge freedom. They're orthogonal to the main discussion here.
Clarifying MCDA relevance
I can outline the conditions under which MCDA becomes relevant, such as when selecting alternatives, determining alpha from weights, or applying hard constraints. However, since we have fixed the structure and are focusing on invariance, MCDA isn't applicable in this discussion. I also need to provide a brief status update since we're not using tools. Here's a simple structure I can follow, with markdown headings and bullets for clarity:
Status Update
No tools are needed for this discussion.
Scope
Conditions for using MCDA.
Nature of MCDA/Rules
Focus on preferences and constraints.
When They’d Matter
Relevant in alternative selection or hard constraints.
Orthogonality
MCDA exists outside the parameters of this discussion.
Impact on Current Results
Does not alter the mathematics involved.
Quick status: Clarifying scope—why MCDA/rules are out of scope for gauge freedom, threshold transfer, and sensitivity invariants. No blockers.

### Why MCDA/rules don’t enter here
- Scope of discussion
  - We’re analyzing properties of a continuous score Ψ: gauge freedom (param renaming), threshold transfer (τ scaling with β), and sensitivity invariants (sign/zeros of derivatives).
  - These are structural properties of the scoring map and its thresholds, independent of discrete choices or policy constraints.

- What MCDA/rules are for
  - MCDA: derive preference weights over discrete alternatives; stakeholder trade‑offs; portfolio ranking.
  - Rules: hard constraints/compliance (“must/never” conditions), deterministic gates.
  - Both operate on option sets or feasibility, not on the internal calculus of Ψ.

- Orthogonality to the current results
  - Gauge freedom: Renaming parameters leaves Ψ unchanged. Restricting actions (rules) or sourcing α from MCDA weights does not alter Ψ’s functional form.
  - Threshold transfer: τ′ = τ·(β/β′) equivalence holds wherever the cap is inactive, regardless of which options are allowed or how α was chosen.
  - Sensitivity invariants: ∂Ψ/∂α, ∂Ψ/∂R_a, ∂Ψ/∂R_v preserve sign/zeros. Constraining A to a subset or fixing α via MCDA does not change these derivatives.

- When they would matter
  - If we needed to: (a) encode non‑negotiable constraints (rules) before acting, or (b) set α from stakeholder weights (MCDA).
  - Even then, they only restrict the feasible action set or set α’s value; they don’t change the invariance and equivalence proofs about Ψ itself.

- Bottom line
  - MCDA/rules shape “what you’re allowed/prefer to do,” not “how Ψ behaves.” This discussion is about Ψ’s internal structure and invariances, so MCDA/rules are not engaged.

- The current topic is Ψ’s structural properties; MCDA/rules affect feasibility/preferences, not Ψ’s form.
- They’d matter only to set α or prune actions; they don’t change gauge freedom, threshold transfer, or sensitivity invariants.
