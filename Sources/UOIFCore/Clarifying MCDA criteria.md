Clarifying MCDA criteria
I need to answer the user's question about Ψ and its role in MCDA. Yes, Ψ is indeed one criterion, while others include cost, risk, time, ROI, and compliance flags. These other criteria help enforce feasibility through rules, but they don't change Ψ itself. I should clarify that "others" are separate, serving as domain objectives and not altering Ψ computation; they influence the selection stage. I might also provide a flow diagram or pseudocode to visualize this process.Addressing transformed criteria and status
I need to clarify if "others" can include transformed Ψ, like uncertainty and variance, but I want to keep it concise. The instructions say to maintain minimal verbosity, so I’ll use bullet points for clarity. I should also consider that there’s a requirement for a status update, even if we're not calling any tools right now. It looks like including a quick status line is expected. I’ll use markdown headings with '###' to make it skimmable and user-friendly.
Crafting the MCDA explanation
First, I need to confirm that Ψ is a continuous criterion, while others serve as domain criteria. The rules act as hard constraints, and MCDA aggregates Ψ with the other criteria, which support stakeholder trade-offs without affecting Ψ calculation. 
Typical "others" include cost, delivery time, risk appetite, and compliance. These criteria come from sources like product plans and engineering constraints. Rules will filter using "must/never," creating a criteria vector [Ψ, cost, time, risk, ROI]. Lastly, I’ll emphasize that preferences shouldn’t be encoded into α, but rather into MCDA weights. I'll keep it concise, adding a pseudocode snippet.

### Short answer
- Yes: Ψ is a continuous evidence-confidence criterion.
- “Others” are orthogonal decision criteria (e.g., cost, time, ROI, compliance) used for MCDA weighting and rules filtering.
- Rules are hard constraints (must/never) that gate feasibility; they don’t change Ψ. MCDA aggregates Ψ with the other criteria to pick among feasible options.

### How they fit together
- Rules (feasibility): license/compliance/data-policy/platform fit → filter options; does not alter Ψ.
- Ψ (confidence): continuous, monotone, bounded evidence score for each remaining option.
- Other MCDA criteria: cost, delivery time, expected value/ROI, operational risk, maintainability, team expertise, strategic fit.

### Minimal wiring
- Feasible set F = {a ∈ A | rules satisfied}.
- For a ∈ F, compute criteria c(a) = [Ψ(a), cost(a), time(a), ROI(a), …].
- Choose a via MCDA aggregator M(c(a), w) that is strictly increasing in Ψ.

### Important separation
- Keep α (evidence allocation inside Ψ) independent of stakeholder preferences.
- Put stakeholder trade‑offs into MCDA weights w, not into Ψ.

- Clarified that Ψ is a continuous criterion; other criteria are for MCDA trade‑offs and rules feasibility.
