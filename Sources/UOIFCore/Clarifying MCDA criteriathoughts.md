Clarifying MCDA criteria
I need to answer the user's question about Ψ and its role in MCDA. Yes, Ψ is indeed one criterion, while others include cost, risk, time, ROI, and compliance flags. These other criteria help enforce feasibility through rules, but they don't change Ψ itself. I should clarify that "others" are separate, serving as domain objectives and not altering Ψ computation; they influence the selection stage. I might also provide a flow diagram or pseudocode to visualize this process.
Addressing transformed criteria and status
I need to clarify if "others" can include transformed Ψ, like uncertainty and variance, but I want to keep it concise. The instructions say to maintain minimal verbosity, so I’ll use bullet points for clarity. I should also consider that there’s a requirement for a status update, even if we're not calling any tools right now. It looks like including a quick status line is expected. I’ll use markdown headings with '###' to make it skimmable and user-friendly.
Crafting the MCDA explanation
First, I need to confirm that Ψ is a continuous criterion, while others serve as domain criteria. The rules act as hard constraints, and MCDA aggregates Ψ with the other criteria, which support stakeholder trade-offs without affecting Ψ calculation. 
Typical "others" include cost, delivery time, risk appetite, and compliance. These criteria come from sources like product plans and engineering constraints. Rules will filter using "must/never," creating a criteria vector [Ψ, cost, time, risk, ROI]. Lastly, I’ll emphasize that preferences shouldn’t be encoded into α, but rather into MCDA weights. I'll keep it concise, adding a pseudocode snippet.

Quick status: I’ll scan your `Farmer` directory for any mention of CC0/Creative Commons/license headers to point to where CC0 is declared. Then I’ll summarize exact file/line locations. No blockers.

Scanning your repo to verify any explicit CC0 grant. I’ll open the file that mentions CC0 and also search for SPDX CC0 identifiers or LICENSE files.

Quick status: I searched your project for any CC0 declarations (SPDX tags, LICENSE files, “Creative Commons Zero”) and found none. One note file mentions CC0 as an option, but it is not a grant.

### What I found
- No `LICENSE`, `COPYING`, or SPDX “CC0-1.0” headers.
- Only a planning note referencing CC0 (not a license grant):
```1:26:/Users/ryan_david_oates/Farmer/Sources/UOIFCore/Evaluating licensing for Ψ framework.sty
I suggest CC BY 4.0 or CC0 for no strings attached ...
Docs/specs/LaTeX: CC BY 4.0 (attribution required). If you want zero frictions, CC0.
```

### Conclusion
- There is currently no place in the repo that declares “underlying mathematical content is CC0.” If you intended CC0, it has not been published yet.

### Fastest way to make it true (pick one)
- Top‑level license (recommended):
  - Create `LICENSE` with “CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication” text from `https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode`.
- SPDX header in files that express the math (optional but nice):
  - Add to the top of `.tex`, `.md`: `%% SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0` (LaTeX) or `<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0 -->` (Markdown).
- Short notice in README (optional):
  - “Mathematical content and accompanying text are dedicated to the public domain under CC0 1.0.”

If you want, I can add the `LICENSE` file and insert SPDX headers in your key docs now.
