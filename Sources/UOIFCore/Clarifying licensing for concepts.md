Clarifying licensing for concepts
The user clarified their question about the "trivial bijection" concept’s license. I need to explain succinctly that mathematical theorems and concepts themselves are not copyrightable; it's the expression (like text or LaTeX) that is. The trivial bijection as an idea isn't bound by a license. If they want to license their write-up or proofs, I could suggest options like CC BY 4.0 or CC0. For code, common licenses are MIT or LPPL, especially if they’re using .sty files.
Mapping licensing details
Here's a quick mapping for the user: Concepts and proof ideas are unprotectable, so no license is required for those. For text in proof1.tex and trivialbijection.md, I suggest choosing between CC BY 4.0 or CC0. For the .sty files, LPPL 1.3c is recommended. If they want a dual license, they should unify under a root LICENSES/ folder with separate files and SPDX headers. Also, adding a notice like, "This document is licensed under CC BY 4.0. The underlying mathematical content is public domain via CC0," is a good idea.
Summarizing licensing requirements
Following the markdown specification, I'll keep it clean with headings and bullet points. Here's a concise breakdownShort answer: No license is needed for the concept—just for the expression.
  
If licensing the trivial bijection write-up, consider: CC BY 4.0 or CC0 for math write-ups; LPPL 1.3c for LaTeX packages; and MIT/Apache-2.0 for code snippets.
Here are some ready-to-use LICENSE headers:

And for the .sty files, I’ll provide SPDX lines in a minimal format.
Clarifying license headers
For the .sty files, I'll include this header:For code blocks, use the short form of the MIT license header. Also, it's worth noting that the name "trivial bijection" can't be trademarked since licensing and trademarks are separate.
To summarize:
Use the LPPL-1.3c for .sty files.


Deploy the MIT short header for code blocks.
Remember, naming concepts like "trivial bijection" isn't covered by licensing rules.Quick status: Clarifying licensing specifically for the “trivial bijection of Ψ” concept vs. your write‑ups/artifacts. No blockers.

### Short answer
- The trivial bijection is a mathematical idea; ideas and theorems are not copyrightable. There’s nothing to “license” about the concept itself.
- You can (and should) license your expression of it: the LaTeX write‑ups, notes, and any `.sty`/code you distribute.

### Recommended licensing by artifact
- Prose/LaTeX docs (e.g., `proof1.tex`, `trivialbijection.md`): CC BY 4.0 (attribution) or CC0 (public domain dedication).
- LaTeX packages/styles (e.g., `.sty`): LPPL 1.3c (standard for TeX packages).
- Code snippets/utilities embedded in the repo: MIT or Apache-2.0 (Apache adds patent grant).

### Paste‑ready headers
- LaTeX document header (CC BY 4.0)
  ```latex
  % © 2025 Your Name. Licensed under CC BY 4.0.
  % https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
  ```
- LaTeX package `.sty` header (LPPL 1.3c)
  ```latex

  % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, version 1.3c.

Notes
- You can dual‑license: prose under CC BY 4.0 (or CC0), code under Apache‑2.0/MIT, `.sty` under LPPL.
- Trademarks/naming (“trivial bijection of Ψ”) are separate from copyright.

- The trivial bijection concept itself needs no license; only your expression does.
- Suggested: CC BY 4.0 (or CC0) for documents, LPPL 1.3c for `.sty`, MIT/Apache‑2.0 for code; ready-to-paste headers provided.
