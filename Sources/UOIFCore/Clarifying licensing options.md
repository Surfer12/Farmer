Clarifying licensing options
It seems the user is referring to “gnu v3” likely meaning the GNU GPL v3 license for their mathematical content. I should clarify that the GPL applies to coding, not the ideas themselves; mathematical concepts can’t be licensed, only their expression. For written materials, using GNU FDL or CC BY-SA is more suitable. If they prefer GPL, I can guide them on applying it to the code while suggesting CC BY-SA for LaTeX.
Providing licensing guidance
I need to create a paste-ready LICENSE header including SPDX tags, and I should point out that the GPL imposes strong copyleft on derivative code. Although we're not using tools, I can still provide brief status updates. I'll prepare a summary at the end in bullet points. It’s important to clarify that underlying mathematical concepts can't be licensed, just their expressions. I’ll ask for confirmation on whether they want to relicense code under GPLv3 and documentation under CC BY-SA 4.0 or all under GPLv3.
Creating license snippets
I need to provide paste-ready snippets, starting with the LICENSE, which should mention "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007" along with a link, but not the full text. It’s acceptable to offer a minimal pointer, but including the full text from gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt is better for compliance. I’ll also include examples of SPDX headers and optional clarifications in the NOTICE. I need to caution about compatibility between CC0 and GPL; underlying math remains in the public domain but can be licensed as expressions under GPLv3.
Producing licensing guidelines
I need to make a short correction: mathematical ideas aren't copyrightable, and the GPL applies only to code. It’s better to use CC BY-SA or GFDL for documentation, though you can license your LaTeX or code under GPLv3. 
For action steps, I should decide the scope—either code under GPLv3, docs under CC BY-SA, or everything under GPLv3. I'll prepare paste-ready headers for both code and LaTeX, add a top-level NOTICE, and provide a compatibility note about GPLv3 and CC BY-SA. I’ll keep everything concise and easy to understand.Quick status: Clarifying scope and giving paste-ready license text. Short correction: math ideas aren’t licensable; GPLv3 applies to code and to your written expression if you choose.

### What “underlying mathematical content is GNU v3” can (and can’t) mean
- Facts/ideas/proofs: not copyrightable. You can’t put GPLv3 on the math itself.
- Your expression/implementation: you can license your LaTeX, Markdown, and code under GPLv3 (strong copyleft), or split: code→GPLv3, docs→CC BY‑SA/GFDL.

### Two safe setups
- All‑GPLv3 (max copyleft):
  - Code and docs: GPL‑3.0‑or‑later.
  - Note: journals/publishers may dislike GPL on prose.
- Split (common in practice):
  - Code: GPL‑3.0‑or‑later.
  - Docs (LaTeX/MD): CC BY‑SA 4.0 (or GFDL 1.3).

### Paste‑ready snippets
- Top‑level LICENSE (code) — include full text from gnu.org:
  - “GNU General Public License v3.0 — https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt”
- SPDX headers:
  - Code: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later`
  - LaTeX (GPL): `% SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later`
  - LaTeX (CC BY-SA): `% SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-SA-4.0`
- NOTICE (optional):
  ```
  This repository’s code is licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later.
  Documentation is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 (unless otherwise noted).
  GPLv3 text: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt
  CC BY-SA 4.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/
  ```

### Compatibility notes (concise)
- You cannot retroactively “convert” previously public‑domain math; you can relicense your expression now.
- GPLv3 is for software; using it for prose is allowed but uncommon. Prefer CC BY‑SA/GFDL for docs if you want share‑alike.
- Strong copyleft: derivatives must remain under GPLv3 (code) or BY‑SA (docs).

- Corrected scope: GPLv3 can cover your expression/implementation, not the math itself.
- Gave two setups (all‑GPLv3 vs split), SPDX headers, and minimal LICENSE/NOTICE pointers.
