Considering licensing options
I think it’s important to include an explicit license, like an internal use grant or NDA. I should suggest simple options, such as an Internal Use License snippet, a Contributor License Agreement, or even a public license for open-source intentions. For clarity, I’ll provide paste-ready text for the Internal Use License and keep formatting light. Finally, I’m considering whether to recommend a split, perhaps using a document with something like an "Internal Evaluation License."
Creating a collaboration license template
I'm thinking about providing a short template for an Internal Collaboration License. It should grant a non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free license for internal use, while including restrictions like no redistribution outside of collaboration and maintaining confidentiality. I also want contributors to license their contributions back to the project, with clear terms for termination and choice of governing law. 
I might offer a standard PolyForm Internal Use License or CC BY-NC options but emphasize that those may not be ideal. Finally, I'll suggest adding LICENSE headers but be cautious in pushing code edits unless requested.
Clarifying licensing issues
I’m considering how to respond regarding the license question. It’s not automatic; unless one is added, no license exists. I should suggest checking the organization’s policy as it may function as a license. I’ll provide steps to verify, like looking for a LICENSE file, but we’ve covered that before.
For mapping internal collaborations, if “others” are inside the organization, that’s fine. If they’re external, an NDA or license is needed. I also want to point out that while math ideas aren’t normally licensable, the expression can be. I’ll wrap this up with a concise summary and a short internal license template.
Quick status: Clarifying “internal between me and others” and giving a paste‑ready internal-use licensQuick status: Clarifying “internal between me and others” and giving a paste‑ready internal-use license you can drop in. No blockers.

### Short answer
- No, not automatically. Unless you added a license or have an agreement in place, your materials are “all rights reserved.” Internal sharing is usually governed by employment/contract/NDAs—not by an OSS license.
- If collaborators are outside your org (or you want clarity inside), add an explicit internal-use license or rely on an NDA + contribution terms.

### Practical options
- Same org: rely on company policy/IP assignment + add a short “Confidential — Internal Use Only” notice.
- Cross‑org collaborators: use an NDA and/or include a simple internal‑use license (below).
- Planning to open‑source later: preselect a public license now but keep the repo private until release.

### Paste‑ready internal‑use license (short)
Create `LICENSE-Internal-Use.txt`:
```
LicenseRef-Internal-Use-Only v1.0

Grant: The Owner grants Collaborators a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, and modify this work solely for internal evaluation and collaboration on this project.

Restrictions: No distribution outside the collaboration; no sublicensing; retain copyright and license notices; treat non-public materials as confidential.

Contributions: Each Contributor grants the Owner a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license to use and relicense their contributions for the project. Contributors represent they have the right to contribute.

IP/Patents: No patent license is granted beyond what is necessary to use the contribution internally. No trademark rights.

Termination: This license terminates automatically upon breach or upon written notice. On termination, stop all use except archival records.

No Warranty / No Liability: The work is provided “AS IS” without warranties. To the extent permitted by law, the Owner disclaims liability.

Governing Law: [Your jurisdiction].
```

Add per-file headers where helpful:
- LaTeX/MD: `% LicenseRef-Internal-Use-Only v1.0 — Confidential / Internal Use Only`
- Code: `// LicenseRef-Internal-Use-Only v1.0 — Confidential / Internal Use Only`

Optional standard alternative
- Use a known internal license like PolyForm Internal Use 1.0.13 and add its text as `LICENSE`.

- Internal work isn’t auto‑licensed; default is “all rights reserved” under your org’s policies/NDAs.
- For clarity with collaborators, add a simple Internal‑Use license or NDA; provided a short template and file/header lines.Quick status: Clarifying “internal between me and others” and giving a paste‑ready internal-use license you can drop in. No blockers.
