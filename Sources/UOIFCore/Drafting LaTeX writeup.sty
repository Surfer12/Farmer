Drafting LaTeX writeup
The user has asked me to draft a full writeup in LaTeX concerning licensing options, such as internal vs. public use, CC0 vs. GPL, and a paste-ready internal-use license. They likely want a comprehensive document that explains these licensing decisions, formatted with sections and possibly including a sample internal use license text, instructions, SPDX headers, and disclaimers. I need to ensure that I cover all relevant aspects in a clear, organized manner.
Outlining licensing writeup
It looks like I’m drafting a full writeup about licensing related to the Ψ topic and the concept of trivial bijection. I’ll clarify that mathematical ideas can’t be licensed, just their expressions. I'll cover options like internal-only licenses and public domain choices such as CC0 or CC BY. Additionally, I need to provide the internal license text in an appendix, include implementation steps, mention NDAs for cross-organizational use, and maybe create a "Policy matrix" while keeping formatting minimal.
Drafting LaTeX document
I need to follow the developer instructions and present a LaTeX document without being too verbose. The user is asking for a draft, so I’ll showcase the LaTeX code in a markdown fenced block. This will include the document class, necessary packages like amsmath and hyperref, along with the title: "Licensing the Ψ Framework: Internal Collaboration, Public Release, and Mathematical Content." I'll outline sections such as the introduction, licensing ideas vs. expression, internal collaboration details, and include the internal-use license text as Appendix A with sample headers.
Detailing licensing options
In the writeup, I need to cover public release options: using CC0 for math, CC BY 4.0 or CC BY-SA for documents, and MIT/Apache/GPL for code, while noting their interplay. I’ll provide a CC0 statement and sample notices, including disclaimers. For code licensed under GPLv3, I should mention complexities and compatibility. It’s also necessary to discuss dual licensing and how to organize files with sample LICENSE and NOTICE content. I’ll clarify the previous confusion regarding licensing mathematical content neutrally

Preparing LaTeX implementation
I’m laying out the implementation checklist and appendices for the licensing document. I think it’s a good idea to include a table in LaTeX summarizing the license varieties per artifact category, like math content, documents, and code. I'll keep it self-contained and include minimal disclaimers stating it’s not legal advice. While adhering to markdown formatting, I'll provide a quick status update, then follow with the LaTeX code block. The document will have sections on the scope, collaboration, and public release options, alongside appendices for internal licenses and notices.

\title{Licensing the \texorpdfstring{$\Psi$}{Psi} Work: Internal Collaboration, Public Release, and Underlying Mathematics}
\author{}
\date{}

\newcommand{\todo}{\textcolor{red}{[verify]}}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document clarifies what can be licensed in the context of the $\Psi$ decision framework, distinguishes internal collaboration from public distribution, and provides paste-ready text for (i) an Internal-Use license, (ii) CC0 1.0 dedication for underlying mathematical content and/or prose, and (iii) GPLv3 (or alternatives) for software. It also includes NOTICE language and SPDX headers for files. This is not legal advice.
\end{abstract}

\section*{1.\quad Scope and Non-legal Disclaimer}
This writeup explains practical licensing choices for:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item Underlying mathematical ideas, definitions, theorems, and proofs (conceptual content).
  \item Your written expression (e.g., \LaTeX{}, Markdown) of those ideas.
  \item Code, \texttt{.sty} files, scripts, and templates implementing or formatting the work.
\end{itemize}
It is informational only and not legal advice.

\section*{2.\quad What is (and is not) Being Licensed}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item \textbf{Ideas/math (concepts):} Facts, methods, and theorems themselves are not protected by copyright. You do not ``license'' the idea of $\Psi$ or its trivial bijection. Patents and trade secrets are different regimes (out of scope).
  \item \textbf{Expression:} Your prose, \LaTeX{} source, figures, and code \emph{are} protected by copyright and can be licensed.
  \item \textbf{Distribution trigger:} Licenses matter when you share outside your organization or outside an NDA. Internal-only materials are, by default, ``all rights reserved'' unless you state otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\section*{3.\quad Internal Collaboration (same or cross organization)}
If you share internally (or with named collaborators under NDA), you typically do \emph{not} need an open-source license. To avoid ambiguity:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item Add a short proprietary header: ``Confidential --- Internal Use Only.''
  \item Optionally attach a simple Internal-Use license (Appendix~A) that grants collaborators permission to use/modify within the project but prohibits redistribution.
  \item If collaborators are external, ensure an NDA and clear contribution terms are in place.
\end{itemize}

\section*{4.\quad Public Release Options (split by artifact)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item \textbf{Underlying math and/or prose:} If you want \emph{no} encumbrances, dedicate to the public domain via CC0 1.0 Universal.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Canonical URL: \href{https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/}{creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/}
    \item Use a short NOTICE and optionally include SPDX headers (Appendix~B).
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Documentation (if not CC0):} CC BY 4.0 (attribution) or CC BY-SA 4.0 (share-alike) are common.
  \item \textbf{Code:} Choose MIT/Apache-2.0 (permissive) or GPL-3.0-or-later (strong copyleft).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item GPLv3 text: \href{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt}{gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt}
    \item Apache-2.0: \href{https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0}{apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0}
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\LaTeX{} packages (\texttt{.sty}):} LPPL~1.3c is conventional, but you may align with your doc license if preferred.
\end{itemize}

\section*{5.\quad Recommended Layouts (two common patterns)}
\paragraph{A. ``All Open'' with clear split.}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item Underlying math/prose: CC0 1.0 (or CC BY 4.0 if attribution desired).
  \item Code: Apache-2.0 (or MIT).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{B. Strong Copyleft for code; CC for docs.}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item Documentation: CC BY-SA 4.0 (or GFDL 1.3).
  \item Code: GPL-3.0-or-later.
\end{itemize}

\section*{6.\quad Minimal Implementation Checklist}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item Decide license per artifact class (math/prose vs.\ code).
  \item Add top-level \texttt{LICENSE} (or multiple, e.g., \texttt{LICENSE-CODE}, \texttt{LICENSE-DOCS}).
  \item Add \texttt{NOTICE.md} summarizing what applies to what.
  \item Insert per-file SPDX headers (Appendix~C).
  \item If internal-only now but planning to publish later, keep internal notices and stage the public license files for release.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{7.\quad Notes on ``GNU v3 for the underlying math''}
GPLv3 (GNU v3) is designed for software. You can apply GPLv3 to your \emph{expression} (e.g., \LaTeX{} sources), but not to the math itself (ideas). If your goal is to keep derivatives open in software, GPLv3 for code is appropriate; for prose, consider CC BY-SA 4.0 instead of GPLv3.
