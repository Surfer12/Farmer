Evaluating licensing for Ψ framework
I need to address the user's question about the license for Ψ, which relates to a framework or decision method. Since there's no repo with a license file, I should clarify that ideas or algorithms aren't copyrightable, but expressions are. If the user wants to publish, I’ll suggest licenses like CC BY 4.0 for documents and Apache-2.0 for code. I can also offer to create a LICENSE file if needed while keeping my response concise.
Clarifying licensing for Ψ
The rules indicate that I should keep going until the problem is solved, and in this case, the question is pretty straightforward. I know we should prefer using absolute paths and that we can run tools, but for now, it's not necessary. I’ll provide a brief status update and a summary as per the developer flow. 
Summary  
State: Ψ is a decision framework and isn't currently under a license unless a repo includes one. Methods themselves aren't copyrightable; however, the written documentation is. If the user wants a license, I’ll suggest they choose one.
Recommending licenses and options
I need to provide three recommended licenses for different contexts. For documentation and specs, I suggest CC BY 4.0 or CC0 for no strings attached, and CC BY-SA as an option. For code and templates, MIT is a simple choice, along with Apache-2.0 for patent grants, or BSD-3-Clause. Lastly, for an academic preprint, arXiv with CC BY 4.0 works well.
If they want to reserve the name "Psi," I'll mention that trademarks are separate. I can offer to add LICENSE files and headers. The default statement we can use is "All rights reserved," but I should note that modern GitHub treats "no license" as all rights reserved. Additionally, I can mention a dual license option: CC BY for prose and Apache-2.0 for code. I'll keep it concise and provide these details!
Quick status: Clarifying licensing for the Ψ framework; no code edits needed. No blockers.

### Short answer
- There’s no license unless you’ve added one. Absent a `LICENSE`, your text/code are “All rights reserved” by default.
- The method itself (the idea of Ψ) isn’t copyrightable; your written text, diagrams, and code are.

### Recommended licensing (simple, safe defaults)
- Docs/specs/LaTeX: CC BY 4.0 (attribution required). If you want zero frictions, CC0.
- Code/snippets/templates: Apache-2.0 (includes patent grant). If you prefer minimalism, MIT.
- Optional: dual-license the repo
  - Prose: CC BY 4.0
  - Code: Apache-2.0

### Notes
- Trademarks are separate; licensing doesn’t reserve the name “Ψ”.
- If you want me to, I can add `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files (docs: CC BY 4.0; code: Apache-2.0) and a `CITATION.cff`.

- No license present means “All rights reserved.” Suggested: CC BY 4.0 for prose and Apache-2.0 for code; method itself isn’t protected, your expression is.
