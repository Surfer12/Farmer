Explaining licensing for internal frameworks
I need to respond clearly to the user's question about licensing for an internal-only decision framework. Essentially, licenses are necessary for distribution, so if it’s purely internal, a license isn’t needed—just company policy. We can add “all rights reserved” internally or include a NOTICE for proprietary content. If the intention is to publish later, recommending a license upfront, like GPLv3 or MIT for code, could avoid confusion. It’s helpful to provide clear options for internal use and copyright marking.
Clarifying internal licensing
I need to explain that if the framework is shared internally between organizations or contractors, the license might be included in contracts instead of the code. An EULA or internal policy would be appropriate. 
I'll keep my response concise with ready-to-use headers and a status update. Here’s a brief summary: 
No license needed if not distributed; copyright attaches automatically; internal policy governs.
For clarity, add a Proprietary Notice and choose an accessible internal license document.
If considering open-sourcing later, snapshot the date and select a license to avoid confusion. 
Examples for file headers include: "Confidential — Internal Use Only" and "© YEAR COMPANY."
Finalizing internal notices
I need to make sure to clarify the rights associated with the internal framework. For instance, I can include a statement like "All rights reserved" in the documentation. 
For classifying information, I should create a NOTICE.md file that incorporates this. If the content is for internal use but shared with vendors, I’ll also need to add a limited license grant statement to ensure clarity. Keeping it all concise will help everyone understand their rights and responsibilities!
Quick status: Clarifying how licensing works for internal-only material and what to add if you want it explicit. No blockers.

### Short answer
- Licenses apply when you distribute. If it’s truly internal (not distributed outside your org), you don’t need an open-source license.
- By default, your expression is copyrighted (“all rights reserved”). Access and use are governed by company policy/NDAs, not a public license.

### When to add something anyway
- To avoid ambiguity, add a proprietary/confidential notice and, if shared with vendors/contractors, a limited internal-use grant.

### Paste-ready headers
- File header
  - LaTeX/MD:
    - `% © 2025 Your Org. All rights reserved.`
    - `% Confidential — Internal Use Only`
  - Code:
    - `// © 2025 Your Org. All rights reserved.`
    - `// Confidential — Internal Use Only`

- NOTICE.md
  ```
  © 2025 Your Org. All rights reserved.
  Classification: Confidential — Internal Use Only
  License: No public license granted. Use restricted by company policy and applicable NDAs.
  ```

- Vendor/contractor share (optional)
  ```
  Licensed to Named Counterparty for internal evaluation/use only.
  No redistribution or derivative rights without written permission.
  ```

### If you plan to publish later
- Decide split licensing up front:
  - Docs/specs: CC BY 4.0 (or CC0 if you want no strings).
  - Code: Apache-2.0 or MIT (or GPL-3.0-or-later if you want strong copyleft).
- Keep internal headers until publication; replace with public LICENSE + SPDX tags at release.

- Internal-only needs no public license; default is “all rights reserved.”
- Use confidential/proprietary notices now; pick an OSS license only when you distribute (or preselect for future release).
