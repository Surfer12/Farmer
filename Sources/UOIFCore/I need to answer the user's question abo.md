I need to answer the user's question about Ψ and its role in MCDA. Yes, Ψ is indeed one criterion, while others include cost, risk, time, ROI, and compliance flags. These other criteria help enforce feasibility through rules, but they don't change Ψ itself. I should clarify that "others" are separate, serving as domain objectives and not altering Ψ computation; they influence the selection stage. I might also provide a flow diagram or pseudocode to visualize this process.

Addressing transformed criteria and status
I need to clarify if "others" can include transformed Ψ, like uncertainty and variance, but I want to keep it concise. The instructions say to maintain minimal verbosity, so I’ll use bullet points for clarity. I should also consider that there’s a requirement for a status update, even if we're not calling any tools right now. It looks like including a quick status line is expected. I’ll use markdown headings with '###' to make it skimmable and user-friendly.
Crafting the MCDA explanation
First, I need to confirm that Ψ is a continuous criterion, while others serve as domain criteria. The rules act as hard constraints, and MCDA aggregates Ψ with the other criteria, which support stakeholder trade-offs without affecting Ψ calculation. 
Typical "others" include cost, delivery time, risk appetite, and compliance. These criteria come from sources like product plans and engineering constraints. Rules will filter using "must/never," creating a criteria vector [Ψ, cost, time, risk, ROI]. Lastly, I’ll emphasize that preferences shouldn’t be encoded into α, but rather into MCDA weights. I'll keep it concise, adding a pseudocode snippet.
