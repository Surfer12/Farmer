[Pesudo] Planning to add explicit CC0 declarations: create a top-level LICENSE-CC0 with the full CC0 1.0 legal code, add a short NOTICE.md pointing to it, and insert SPDX CC0 headers at the top of `proof1.tex` and `trivialbijection.md` so it's visible where the math lives. Reading those files first, then applying edits.

Quick status: I'll add explicit CC0 declarations based on the Creative Commons page: create a top-level CC0 notice, add a short LICENSE file referencing the CC0 legalcode URL, and insert SPDX CC0 headers into `proof1.tex` and `trivialbijection.md` so your public-domain grant is clear where the math lives. Proceeding with the edits now.

Quick status: You can point to the canonical CC0 1.0 Universal legal code on the web and include short notices/SPDX tags. Below are paste‑ready snippets.
