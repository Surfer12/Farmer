Preparing LaTeX Document
I need to create a LaTeX document that includes a theorem and proof focused on why trivial bijection is important. I’ll cover three aspects: gauge freedom, threshold transfer, and sensitivity invariants. The user wants this content formatted correctly in LaTeX. Instead of using tools, I’ll provide the LaTeX code directly. I’ll keep it concise while ensuring to include definitions, notation, and theorems, including relevant proofs and lemmas as needed. I'll summarize at the end, making sure everything is clear.
Formulating Theorem and Proofs
I'm outlining a theorem focused on gauge freedom, which states that if a parameter renaming bijection preserves component functions, then Psi remains invariant. This means two frameworks are observationally equivalent. For threshold transfer, when beta changes to beta', we determine that decision sets remain equal under certain conditions, and I've defined the necessary regions for this. Additionally, I need to address sensitivity invariants, specifically how the derivative of Psi behaves under these conditions. I'll ensure to provide clear proofs for these statements.
Drafting Theorem and Concepts
In discussing the scaling of beta and threshold transfer, I note that the sign of the derivative and critical points remain unchanged. Bijection only involves variable renamingwithout transformation. However, when we extend to scale beta, the derivative scales proportionally across frameworks, and metrics like sign and zero-crossings stay unaffected. I need to ensure that I include all relevant theorems and lemmas, along with a comprehensive LaTeX document that presents definitions, notation, and necessary axioms for clarity. I'll aim to keep it concise but thorough.
Structuring LaTeX Document
I need to ensure the message remains minimal while presenting a LaTeX code block. This code may be long, but that's fine. I'll include necessary packages like amsmath, amsthm, and hyperref, along with macros and theorem environments. Since the user wants proof and theorem, I’ll focus on that without adding confidence annotations to keep it concise. I’ll also integrate definitions for gauge freedom, threshold transfer, and sensitivity invariants, plus an "Operational Significance" section, and an optional remark on saturation boundaries. Let's craft this clearly and effectively!
Finalizing LaTeX Structure
I’m detailing three theorems: 
Theorem 1 deals with gauge freedom and observational equivalence, complete with proof.Theorem 2 focuses on threshold transfer, accompanied by proof and specific conditions.
Theorem 3 covers sensitivity invariants, also with proof.
Additionally, I’ll include a corollary about decision equivalence under parameter renaming and a lemma regarding the saturation boundary. It's important to outline operational implications as well. Finally, I'll create a list of references and ensure to present everything in a markdown code fence for LaTeX, along with a summary bullet list. Let's wrap this up!

\section*{1.\quad Notation and Guardrailed Score}
Let $\Ssig,\Nsig\in[0,1]$ be internal and canonical signal strengths; $\alloc\in[0,1]$ the allocation lever; $\riskvec=(\rA,\rV)\in[0,1]^2$ risks with positive weights $(\lA,\lV)$; and $\uplift\ge 1$ an uplift factor with a hard cap at $1$.
\[
\blend(\alloc)=\alloc\,\Ssig+(1-\alloc)\,\Nsig,\qquad
\pen(\riskvec)=\exp\!\big(-[\lA\rA+\lV\rV]\big).
\]
The guardrailed score is
\[
\score(\Ssig,\Nsig,\alloc,\riskvec,\lA,\lV,\uplift)=\min\Big\{\uplift\cdot \blend(\alloc)\cdot \pen(\riskvec),\,1\Big\}.
\]
A second system uses parameters $(\alpha_g,\lambda_{1g},\lambda_{2g},\beta_g)$:
\[
\gscore=\min\Big\{\beta_g\,[\alpha_g \Ssig+(1-\alpha_g)\Nsig]\exp(-[\lambda_{1g}\rA+\lambda_{2g}\rV]),\,1\Big\}.
\]

We write the \emph{sub-cap region} for a parameterization $p$ as
\[
\mathcal{U}(p)=\left\{(\Ssig,\Nsig,\alloc,\riskvec): \beta_p\,\blend(\alloc)\,\pen(\riskvec) < 1\right\},
\]
i.e., where the cap is inactive.

\section*{2.\quad Concepts of Interest}
\begin{definition}[Gauge freedom]
Two parameterizations are \emph{gauge equivalent} (trivially bijective) if there is a one-to-one renaming of levers $(\alloc,\lA,\lV,\uplift)\leftrightarrow(\alpha_g,\lambda_{1g},\lambda_{2g},\beta_g)$ such that $\score\equiv\gscore$ pointwise.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Threshold transfer]
Given thresholds $\tau,\tau'\in(0,1]$ for two parameterizations, a \emph{threshold transfer} is a mapping $\tau\mapsto\tau'$ such that the induced decision sets coincide on the sub-cap region:
\[
\{\score\ge \tau\}\cap \mathcal{U}(\beta) \;=\; \{\gscore\ge \tau'\}\cap \mathcal{U}(\beta_g).
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Sensitivity invariants]
Directional derivatives of $\score$ with respect to levers $(\alloc,\rA,\rV)$ and signals $(\Ssig,\Nsig)$ that preserve sign and zero-sets under gauge equivalence and under threshold transfer on the sub-cap region.
\end{definition}

\section*{3.\quad Main Results}
\begin{theorem}[Gauge freedom / observational equivalence]
\label{thm:gauge}
If $\alloc:=\alpha_g$, $\lA:=\lambda_{1g}$, $\lV:=\lambda_{2g}$, and $\uplift:=\beta_g$, then $\score\equiv\gscore$ for all inputs. Consequently, any two systems that differ only by such a bijection are observationally indistinguishable: they induce the same rankings and the same thresholded decisions for any common $\tau$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Under the stated identification, the affine blends, exponential penalties, and capped uplifts coincide term-by-term. Equality of the compositions is pointwise, hence identical outputs and orderings. Thresholded decisions also coincide for any $\tau$ since the functions are equal. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Threshold transfer]
\label{thm:threshold}
Fix $\tau\in(0,1]$ for $\score$ with uplift $\beta$ and $\tau'\in(0,1]$ for $\gscore$ with uplift $\beta_g$. On the common sub-cap region $\mathcal{U}(\beta)\cap\mathcal{U}(\beta_g)$, setting
\[
\tau' \;=\; \tau\cdot \frac{\beta}{\beta_g}
\]
yields decision equivalence:
\[
\{\score\ge \tau\}\cap \mathcal{U}(\beta)\cap\mathcal{U}(\beta_g) \;=\; \{\gscore\ge \tau'\}\cap \mathcal{U}(\beta)\cap\mathcal{U}(\beta_g).
\]
Moreover, if one side saturates at the cap while the other remains sub-cap, the accepting set of the saturated side weakly contains that of the sub-cap side.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
On $\mathcal{U}(\beta)\cap\mathcal{U}(\beta_g)$ the caps are inactive, so
\[
\score=\beta\,\blend\,\pen,\qquad \gscore=\beta_g\,\blend\,\pen.
\]
Then $\score\ge\tau \iff \beta\,\blend\,\pen\ge \tau \iff \blend\,\pen\ge \tau/\beta \iff \beta_g\,\blend\,\pen \ge \tau\cdot \frac{\beta_g}{\beta} \iff \gscore\ge \tau'$
with $\tau'=\tau\,\beta/\beta_g$. If saturation occurs on one side, replacing its value by $1$ only enlarges its acceptance set, giving weak containment.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Sensitivity invariants]
\label{thm:sensitivity}
On the sub-cap region for a given parameterization,
\[
\frac{\partial \score}{\partial \alloc} = (\,\Ssig-\Nsig\,)\,\beta\,\pen,\quad
\frac{\partial \score}{\partial \rA} = -\,\beta\,\blend\,\lA\,\pen,\quad
\frac{\partial \score}{\partial \rV} = -\,\beta\,\blend\,\lV\,\pen.
\]
Under gauge freedom (Theorem \ref{thm:gauge}), these derivatives coincide pointwise. If only the uplift differs ($\beta\mapsto\beta_g$), derivatives scale by the constant factor $\beta_g/\beta$, preserving (i) sign, (ii) zero-sets, and (iii) relative magnitudes across inputs. Therefore, monotonicity directions and stability properties are invariant under bijection, and preserved under threshold transfer.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Differentiate $\score=\beta\,\blend(\alloc)\,\pen(\riskvec)$ in the sub-cap region. The expressions follow by product and chain rules. Under bijection, $\beta,\blend,\pen$ are identical functions, hence derivatives match. If only $\beta$ changes to $\beta_g$, each derivative is multiplied by $\beta_g/\beta>0$, preserving sign and zeros; relative ratios across inputs are also preserved. Threshold transfer does not alter derivatives; it only rescales the decision boundary, leaving sensitivity structure intact on the sub-cap region.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Operational significance]
Gauge freedom implies debates about parameter labels/defaults are non-substantive absent structural changes. Threshold transfer ensures that changing $\beta$ (e.g., new certification strength) can be absorbed by adjusting $\tau$ without altering behavior in sub-cap regimes. Sensitivity invariants guarantee directionally consistent responses to allocation and risk changes, stabilizing reviews and tuning.
\end{corollary}

\section*{4.\quad Saturation Boundary and Safe Containment}
\begin{lemma}[Saturation boundary]
The cap activates exactly on the set $\partial\mathcal{U}(\beta)=\{(\Ssig,\Nsig,\alloc,\riskvec): \beta\,\blend\,\pen=1\}$. Crossing into saturation renders $\partial \score/\partial(\cdot)=0$ in the saturated direction, further stabilizing decisions.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By definition of $\min\{\cdot,1\}$: equality at $1$ triggers the cap. Beyond the boundary, $\score\equiv 1$ locally, so directional derivatives vanish in the saturated region.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Safe containment at the cap]
If $\beta\,\blend\,\pen\ge 1$ and $\beta_g\,\blend\,\pen<1$, then $\{\score\ge\tau\}$ weakly contains $\{\gscore\ge\tau'\}$ for any $\tau\le 1$, since $\score=1$ accepts all points and $\gscore<1$ filters by $\tau'$.
\end{corollary}

\section*{5.\quad What This Means in Practice}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item \textbf{Gauge freedom}: Parameter renames (and equivalent defaults) do not change outcomes; focus on structure (affine+exponential+cap).
  \item \textbf{Threshold transfer}: Adjust thresholds when $\beta$ changes to preserve decisions in sub-cap regimes; prevents churn from re-calibration.
  \item \textbf{Sensitivity invariants}: Signs/zeros of derivatives are stable; tuning is predictable; monotonicity with canonical evidence is retained.
\end{itemize}
