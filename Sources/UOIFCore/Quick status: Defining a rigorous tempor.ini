Quick status: Defining a rigorous temporal version of Ψ that keeps boundedness, sensitivity formulas, and threshold transfer valid.

### Temporal model (well-posed)
- Time/index set: t ∈ T (continuous) or t = 1..K (discrete).
- Weights: w(t) ≥ 0 with ∫_T w(t) dt = 1 (or ∑_t w_t = 1). Choose EMA kernel or uniform window; normalization avoids unit problems.
- Instantaneous components at time t:
  - O_t = α(t) S(t) + (1−α(t)) N(t) ∈ [0,1]
  - pen_t = exp(−[λ1 R_a(t) + λ2 R_v(t)]) ∈ (0,1]
  - post_t = min{β(t) P(H|E_t), 1} ∈ (0,1]
  - Instantaneous score: Ψ_t = O_t · pen_t · post_t ∈ [0,1]

### Two safe aggregators (pick one)
- Normalized average (keeps linear proofs)
  - Aggregated score: Ψ̄ = ∫ w(t) Ψ_t dt  (or Ψ̄ = ∑ w_t Ψ_t)
  - Boundedness: 0 ≤ Ψ̄ ≤ 1 by convexity.
  - Sensitivities (sub‑cap for times where post_t = β(t)P_t):
    - ∂Ψ̄/∂α(s) = w(s) (S(s) − N(s)) β(s) pen_s
    - ∂Ψ̄/∂R_a(s) = −w(s) β(s) O_s λ1 pen_s
    - ∂Ψ̄/∂R_v(s) = −w(s) β(s) O_s λ2 pen_s
  - Threshold transfer (uniform β scaling β(t)→κ·β(t), all Ψ_t sub‑cap): Ψ̄→κ·Ψ̄. To preserve accept set, set τ' = κ·τ.

- Soft‑cap (hazard) aggregator (smooth saturation)
  - Raw intensity: R_t = β(t) O_t pen_t (uncapped, ≥0)
  - Aggregated score: Ψ̄ = 1 − exp(−I), with I = ∫ w(t) R_t dt
  - Boundedness: Ψ̄ ∈ [0,1), monotone in each R_t.
  - Sensitivities: ∂Ψ̄/∂θ = e^{−I} ∫ w(t) ∂R_t/∂θ dt (use ∂R_t as in sub‑cap case).
  - Threshold transfer (uniform β scaling κ): I→κ I, so to keep the same accept set use τ' = 1 − (1 − τ)^{κ}.

### Notes
- If some Ψ_t are capped (post_t=1), use subgradients (0 at the cap) or treat those times as insensitive until evidence recedes.
- For discrete windows, replace integrals with sums; keep weights normalized.

- Defined a normalized time model: per‑time Ψ_t plus two safe aggregators.
- Both keep 0–1 bounds; provided derivatives and correct threshold mapping (linear: τ' = κ·τ; soft‑cap: τ' = 1 − (1 − τ)^{κ}).
