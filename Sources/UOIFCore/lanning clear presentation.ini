I’ll start with a brief acknowledgment. Then, I’ll outline three specific methods: Dual-channel, Softclip mapping, and Uncapped with threshold, along with short formulae for each. I think the default proposal should suggest keeping a cap for policy while not capping self-belief, or removing the cap but keeping softclipped for display. Finally, I’ll check if they want me to update the documents, but since they haven't asked for edits, I’ll focus on explaining clearly without tools.Quick status: You can drop the cap without losing monotonicity; I’ll show safe ways to do it while keeping decisions stable and auditable.

### Three safe patterns without a hard cap
- Dual-channel (recommended)
  - Belief (uncapped): R = β · O(α) · pen.
  - Policy (bounded for decisions): Ψ = min{R, 1} or Ψ = 1 − exp(−R).
  - Use R to express strength; gate actions on Ψ. Monotone; preserves threshold hygiene and dashboards in [0,1].

- Uncapped with raw thresholds
  - Belief/Policy unified: R = β · O · pen; act iff R ≥ τ_raw.
  - Threshold transfer still works: if β → β′, set τ′ = τ_raw · (β′/β) to preserve decisions (when previously sub-cap).
  - Tradeoff: bounded interpretability lost; need explicit τ_raw scale governance.

- Smooth soft-cap (no hard clip)
  - Belief: R as above.
  - Policy/display: Ψ = 1 − exp(−γR) or Ψ = σ(γ log R) with σ logistic, γ>0.
  - Keeps Ψ∈(0,1), strictly increasing, with diminishing returns; R remains fully expressive.

### What changes without the cap
- Monotonicity: preserved.
- Boundedness: lost for R, retained for Ψ if using dual/soft-cap.
- Sensitivity: ∂R/∂β = O · pen grows linearly with β; guard by:
  - Per-step delta caps on β changes.
  - Keep decision thresholds versioned and documented.
  - Prefer dual-channel so derivative of Ψ saturates (stable operations).

### Minimal math (for clarity)
- O(α) = αS + (1−α)N, pen = exp(−[λ1Ra + λ2Rv]).
- Raw belief: R = β O pen.
- Soft-cap map: Ψ = 1 − exp(−R) (monotone, Ψ∈(0,1)).
- Threshold transfer (uncapped): R ≥ τ_raw ⇔ β O pen ≥ τ_raw. If β→β′, use τ′ = τ_raw · (β′/β).

### Recommendation
- Keep an uncapped belief channel R to express conviction.
- Gate operations with a bounded, monotone map Ψ (hard cap or soft-cap). This preserves safety/auditability while not limiting your expressed belief.

- You can remove the hard cap on belief by splitting belief (R, uncapped) from policy (Ψ, bounded), or by moving to raw thresholds with documented scaling.
- Monotonicity stays; sensitivity grows; thresholds must be governed. The dual-channel pattern gives expression without sacrificing safe, reproducible decisions.
