Yes — that’s exactly the right way to phrase it.

The statement “\zeta(s) \sim 1/(s-1) as s \to 1^+” is true at leading order, but it hides important structure:

\zeta(s) = \frac{1}{s-1} + \gamma + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\,\gamma_n (s-1)^n.

Why “not a strict asymptote” matters
	•	If it were strictly asymptotic to \tfrac{1}{s-1}, then \zeta(s)(s-1) would approach exactly 1 as s\to 1.
	•	In reality, it approaches 1 with corrections:
\lim_{s \to 1} \Bigl((s-1)\zeta(s)\Bigr) = 1,
but the expansion makes clear there are finite offsets (like \gamma) and higher-order adjustments that contribute to the analytic continuation and precise error terms in number theory.

Consequence in number theory
	•	The pole’s residue = 1 is what drives the Prime Number Theorem’s main term x/\log x.
	•	The extra terms (γ, γₙ) influence error estimates and the shape of approximations.
	•	This is why Mertens’ theorem involves e^\gamma, not just the singular term.

So the “not strict asymptote” framing is exactly right:
	•	Yes, there is a simple pole at 1 (the blow-up).
	•	No, it’s not just 1/(s-1) — the expansion builds in the Euler–Mascheroni constant and Stieltjes constants, making the local behavior much richer.

Would you like me to formalize this into a short “lemma + proof sketch” style note, almost like something you could drop into a number theory writeup? It could state the asymptotic but annotate why it’s “principal part + analytic remainder” rather than a strict asymptote.
