\section{Analogy: Equivalence Patterns in Enumerative Geometry}

A Looijenga pair $(Y,D)$ (log Calabi–Yau surface of maximal boundary) admits multiple enumerative theories that are provably equivalent in large families: log Gromov–Witten (log GW), local Gromov–Witten (local GW) for associated Calabi–Yau total spaces, open Gromov–Witten (open GW) for toric CY$_3$ with Aganagic–Vafa branes (via a framing), refined/knot–quiver invariants (LMOV), and quiver Donaldson–Thomas (DT) invariants. These equivalences are closed-form solvable in canonical examples and are constructed geometrically via log$\to$open mechanisms and (quantized) scattering diagrams.

\subsection{Canonical example: $ \mathbb{P}^2(1,4)$ (line $+$ conic)}
Let $Y=\mathbb{P}^2$ with $D=D_1+D_2$ where $D_1$ is a line and $D_2$ a conic. The degree-$d$ genus-0 log invariant with maximal tangencies satisfies
\[
R_{0,d}\big(\mathbb{P}^2(1,4)\big)\;=\;\binom{2d}{d}.
\]
Its all-genus $q$-refinement is the quantized binomial coefficient
\[
R_d\big(\mathbb{P}^2(1,4)\big)(q)\;=\;\binom{2d}{d}_q,
\]
matching the open invariant $O_d(\mathbb{C}^3,L, f{=}1)$ and (via multiple-cover/Klemm–Pandharipande) the local CY$_4$ genus-0 counts on $\mathrm{Tot}\,\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2}(-1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2}(-2)$.

\subsection{Geometric mechanism and scattering}
- \textbf{Log $\to$ open}: Designate one boundary component as “open,” remove its ray, record a framing, and twist by remaining toric rays to obtain a toric CY$_3$ with an Aganagic–Vafa Lagrangian; log tangencies correspond to disk windings.
- \textbf{Scattering diagrams}: Quantum broken lines and wall-crossing automorphisms produce the coefficients (e.g., $\binom{2d}{d}_q$) by multiplying theta functions associated to boundary directions; summing over broken lines recovers the refined generating functions.

\subsection{Higher-genus structure and integrality}
Under a positivity assumption (Property O), there is a higher-genus log/open correspondence equating all-genus generating functions. The resulting refined BPS series are Laurent polynomials with integer coefficients, providing a refinement of local (CY$_4$) KP invariants. In many two-boundary cases, the same numbers equal quiver DT invariants (e.g., the $2$-loop quiver).

\subsection{Connection to $\Psi$-framework invariants}
These equivalences mirror our structural invariance results:
- \textbf{Gauge freedom}: Different presentations (log/local/open/quiver) preserve the same counting structure, analogous to reparameterization-equivalence of $\Psi$.
- \textbf{Threshold transfer}: Framing/winding reparametrizations preserve decision sets within the “sub-cap” (unsaturated) regime, paralleling $\tau'=\tau\cdot(\beta/\beta')$.
- \textbf{Sensitivity invariants}: Order and monotonicity are preserved under structural moves, akin to sign/zero-set preservation of $\partial\Psi$ under trivial reparameterizations.
