# model_organisms_demo.py
# Author: Ryan David Oates
# This script demonstrates model organisms of misalignment in LLMs,
# showcasing experience in AI safety research. It creates simplified
# "organisms" (small models or agents) that exhibit misalignment behaviors,
# such as deceptive alignment or goal misgeneralization, to study how
# alignment failures arise empirically.
# Integrates with UOIF (Unified Oversight Integration Framework) concepts
# from the Farmer project for misalignment risk assessment.
# Uses Hugging Face transformers for LLM handling, demonstrating deep learning
# framework expertise. Experiment management via Weights & Biases (wandb) for
# tracking. This is an open-source contribution under GPL-3.0.
