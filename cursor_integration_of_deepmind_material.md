- Context/primitives (historical mirror): [https://olympiads.win.tue.nl/imo](https://olympiads.win.tue.nl/imo)

Role hierarchy (for primitives): Official (when posted) > DeepMind/Evan (expert interpretive) > AoPS (community) > mirror (context).

### Scoring and allocation (current)
- 2025 (expert-only, no official page cited here): N(x)=0.92 (DeepMind blog+solutions PDF + Evan), α(primitives)=0.18, P(H|E)=0.90, β=1.08; penalty exp(−[λ1·0.25+λ2·0.10]) with λ1=0.85, λ2=0.15 → ≈0.7965. O_hybrid ≈ 0.18·0.60 + 0.82·0.92 = 0.864. Ψ(x) ≈ 0.864·0.7965·(0.972) ≈ 0.669. Label: Interpretive/Contextual; strong expert corroboration (await official posting for promotion).
- 2024 (expert + widely mirrored primitives): N(x)=0.95 (DeepMind solution pages + mirror), α(primitives)=0.12, P(H|E)=0.92, β=1.10; penalty ≈0.8737. O_hybrid ≈ 0.12·0.60 + 0.88·0.95 = 0.908. Ψ(x) ≈ 0.908·0.8737·1.0 ≈ 0.793. Label: Primitive/Empirically grounded.

### UOIF dialectical synthesis (minimal rules)
- Evidence order (non-commutative): 2025/2024 primitives → read DeepMind (and official when live) before Evan/AoPS; interpretations → combine Evan + DeepMind, then AoPS.
- Gating:
  - Primitives: require DeepMind’s official claims page and/or official IMO page (when posted). 2025 remains “pending official” notwithstanding DeepMind’s coordinator-certified grading claim; 2024 may be treated as grounded with DeepMind solution pages plus mirror.
  - Interpretations: cite Evan and DeepMind pages; add AoPS when extracting alternative arguments.
- Conflict resolution: if DeepMind and Evan disagree on a step, present both and defer to official artifacts when available; do not let mirror override expert content.
- Versioning: cite stable URLs above; prefer DeepMind PDF for 2025 solutions, per their blog.

### Next actions
- 2025: Add official IMO links when published; reduce α(primitives) to 0.10–0.15, set N(x)→0.96–0.98, β→1.15; Ψ(x) expected >0.75 → promote to Primitive.
- 2024: Keep DeepMind solution index and pages as primary expert interpretive citations; where official text is available, include alongside.

- Incorporated DeepMind’s 2025 gold blog and solutions PDF, DeepMind’s 2024 silver blog and per-problem pages, Evan’s 2025 PDF, and the historical mirror; assigned roles; recomputed Ψ(x): 2025 ≈ 0.669 (interpretive pending official), 2024 ≈ 0.793 (primitive).

**Cursor**

I’m going to check whether the official IMO 2025 pages (problems/results) are live so we can add links and, if so, recompute Ψ(x) with your proposed parameter updates.

Checking for official IMO 2025 pages on the IMO site to add links and, if found, recalculating Ψ(x) with your updated parameters. Running targeted searches in parallel.

Quick check for official IMO 2025 pages; if found, I’ll add the links and recompute 2025 Ψ(x) with α(primitives)=0.12–0.15, N(x)=0.96–0.98, β=1.15. Running multiple targeted searches in parallel.

I'll run broader searches to find the official IMO 2025 `year_info`, `problems`, and `results` pages, using different query patterns and expected URL structures.

Searched for official IMO 2025 pages on the IMO site; none surfaced yet. Proceeding with your proposed 2025 parameter updates and promotion checks.

### 2025 recalculation (proposed updates)
- Assumptions: α(primitives)=0.10–0.15, N(x)=0.96–0.98, β=1.15, S(x)=0.60, penalty=exp(−[0.85·0.25+0.15·0.10])=0.7965, P(H|E,β)=min(0.90×1.15, 1)=1.00.
- O_hybrid = α·0.60 + (1−α)·N(x).
- Results (Ψ(x) = O_hybrid × penalty × P):
  - α=0.10, N=0.98 → O=0.942 → Ψ≈0.750
  - α=0.12, N=0.97 → O=0.9256 → Ψ≈0.738
  - α=0.15, N=0.96 → O=0.906 → Ψ≈0.722
- Takeaway: With your updates, Ψ(x) ranges ≈ 0.722–0.750. To reliably exceed 0.75, keep α near 0.10 and N at ≥0.98, or slightly relax the penalty once official artifacts are added.

### Actions
- 2025: Keep label Interpretive/Contextual until official IMO links are live. On publication, set α≈0.10–0.12 and N≈0.98; Ψ(x) ≥0.75 becomes robust → promote to Primitive.
- 2024: No change; remains Primitive/Empirically grounded at Ψ(x)≈0.793 with current citations.
- Monitoring: Will re-check for official 2025 `imo-official.org` pages (year info/problems/results) and update links and Ψ(x) immediately upon availability.

- Added a search pass for official 2025 pages (none found yet), and recomputed 2025 Ψ(x) under your proposed α, N, β; result is a 0.722–0.750 band with promotion achievable at α≈0.10 and N≈0.98 or with a modest penalty relaxation once official links are included.
