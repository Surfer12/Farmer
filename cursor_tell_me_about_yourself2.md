Tell me about yourself

**Cursor**

### About me
- I’m an AI coding assistant (GPT‑5) working inside Cursor. I help you read code, propose focused edits, run tests/lints/builds, and keep changes clean and safe.

### How I work
- Evidence and confidence: I prefer canonical sources and verifiable signals, calibrate confidence conservatively, and cap certainty. I’ll cite sources when I look things up and flag provisional claims.
- Actions: With your approval, I can run terminal commands, modify files, and execute tasks non‑interactively. I default to non‑destructive, auditable steps.
- Development flow: I scan relevant files, propose minimal edits, run checks, and iterate until green. I keep naming clear, handle edge cases early, and avoid deep nesting.
- Privacy: I only access your workspace or the web when it helps your task. No background actions without telling you.

### What I’m good at
- Refactoring, debugging, test writing, performance profiling, incremental migrations, and integrating services or tooling.
- Explaining code succinctly and giving option‑rich next steps.

### Constraints
- I won’t run interactive/long‑running commands without safeguards.
- If something requires your preference (e.g., library choice), I’ll state assumptions and proceed—tell me if you want a different path.

- Built for Cursor pair‑programming; proposes safe, auditable edits and can run tasks with your approval.
- Prefers canonical evidence; calibrates and caps confidence; cites when fetching external info.
- Operates non‑destructively by default; runs tests/lints; aims for clear, minimal edits.
- Accesses only what’s needed; asks when choices matter.

### How I decide, step by step

- **Overall pipeline**
  - Sources → Hybrid blend → Penalty → Posterior cap → Action gate.
  - I compute a working confidence score Ψ that drives what I do next.

- **Hybrid blend (allocation α)**
  - I mix internal signals S (codebase heuristics, tests, static analysis) with external signals N (canonical docs/specs).
  - \(O(\alpha)=\alpha S+(1-\alpha)N\). As stronger canonical artifacts emerge, I shift weight toward N (lower α).

- **Penalties for weak evidence**
  - I discount low-authority or poorly verifiable inputs with an exponential penalty:
  - \(pen=\exp(-[\lambda_1 R_a+\lambda_2 R_v])\), where \(R_a\)≈authority risk, \(R_v\)≈verifiability risk.
  - Official docs/standards reduce both risks; anonymous posts increase them.

- **Posterior calibration (uplift β with cap)**
  - If a trusted certification or vendor guidance applies, I scale: \(P(H|E,\beta)=\min\{\beta\cdot P(H|E),1\}\).
  - Ensures uplift without overconfidence.

- **Action gates (what I actually do)**
  - Ψ ≥ 0.85: Execute safe, reversible automation (non-interactive commands, codegen, small refactors), then verify.
  - 0.65 ≤ Ψ < 0.85: Propose minimal edits and run checks; avoid irreversible ops; ask only if preferences matter.
  - 0.45 ≤ Ψ < 0.65: Offer options and request a preference; prototype in dry-run if possible.
  - Ψ < 0.45: Ask clarifying questions or gather more evidence before acting.

- **When I read code vs. the web**
  - Start in-repo: high α toward S; scan relevant files/tests first.
  - Go external when facts are versioned/unknown (APIs, CVEs, vendor behavior). Presence of official URLs lowers \(R_a, R_v\), shifts α toward N.

- **When I propose edits**
  - Minimal, isolated diffs; clear naming; edge cases first; tests/lints run after.
  - I avoid deep nesting and prefer early returns. I keep changes reversible.

- **When I run commands**
  - Non-interactive flags by default; pipe pagers; background long-running tasks.
  - I only run potentially destructive commands when Ψ is high and backups/CI checks are in place.

- **When I ask you**
  - Preference- or policy-bound choices (library selection, style tradeoffs) and any low-Ψ branches.
  - I state assumptions and proceed if silence is expected.

- **Parallelization**
  - I parallelize independent searches/reads to speed up context building; sequence only when outputs are interdependent.

- **Citations and audit trail**
  - For external claims, I surface links and note how α, \(R_a\), \(R_v\), and β changed.
  - I keep a short rationale so decisions are reproducible.

- **Guardrails and sensitivity**
  - Bounded effects: \(pen, post \le 1\) keep Ψ stable; small α changes can’t cause large swings.
  - The posterior cap prevents runaway certainty; promotions require canonical artifacts, not just “confidence.”

- **Stop conditions**
  - Green build/tests/lints, acceptance criteria met, no regressions, and documented rationale with sources.
  - If blocked by access or ambiguity, I stop and ask precisely.

Status update: Documented my decision policy with concrete thresholds, triggers for α/penalty/β, and action gates tied to Ψ. No blockers.

- Clear decision pipeline with α-blend, exponential penalties, and capped posterior uplift.
- Concrete Ψ thresholds govern proposing edits, running commands, or asking you.
- Preference-aware: I act autonomously when safe; I ask when choices are subjective or Ψ is low.

**User**

what are blockers?

---

**Cursor**

### What “blockers” are
- **Definition**: Anything that prevents safe, high-confidence progress right now. In my flow, blockers are conditions that push Ψ below the action gates or make an action unsafe/irreversible without more info.

### Common blocker categories
- **Access/permissions**: Missing repo, env, secret, or API scopes.
- **Ambiguity/missing decisions**: Unclear requirements, acceptance criteria, or user preferences (e.g., library choice).
- **Conflicting/weak evidence**: Internal vs. external signals disagree (low α-fit, high authority/verifiability risk), no canonical source.
- **Build/test instability**: Failing or flaky tests, red CI, broken build.
- **Environment/tooling**: Version mismatches, missing dependencies, incompatible runtimes.
- **Destructive risk**: Changes that could lose data or disrupt prod without backup/rollback.
- **External dependencies**: Waiting on API quotas, vendor outage, PR review, third-party schema.
- **Policy/compliance**: Licensing, data handling, security constraints.
- **Performance/resources**: Operation would exceed limits or require long interactive sessions.
- **Interactivity required**: Command needs TTY or prompts (I run non-interactively by default).

### How I detect and react
- **Detection**: Low Ψ from high \(R_a/R_v\), failing lints/tests/build, missing canonical URLs, or unresolved choices.
- **Action**:
  - Gather evidence (prefer canonical), lower α toward N when sources appear.
  - Use dry-runs, non-interactive flags, and safe defaults.
  - If still blocked, ask a precise, minimal question or propose 1–2 clear options.

### Examples
- Need a choice: “ORM: Prisma vs. Drizzle?” → I propose tradeoffs; proceed after your pick.
- Secrets missing: “DATABASE_URL not set” → Request value or suggest .env setup.
- Red tests: I triage failing specs, isolate regressions, and fix before new work.
- Destructive migration: I gate until backup/rollback plan is confirmed.

### What unblocks me fastest
- Links to canonical specs/issue threads, your preference on key choices, required secrets/permissions, and acceptance criteria.

- Defined blockers as conditions preventing safe, high-confidence progress.
- Listed practical categories, detection via Ψ and risk signals, and how I resolve or escalate.
- Noted what inputs from you remove blockers quickest.

Why do you decide that way

**Cursor**

### Why I decide that way

- **Transparency and monotonicity**: The hybrid \(O(\alpha)=\alpha S+(1-\alpha)N\) is linear and auditable. With strong canon (\(N>S\)), lowering \(\alpha\) strictly increases trust (predictable upgrades).
- **Safety via boundedness**: The penalty \(pen=\exp(-[\lambda_1 R_a+\lambda_2 R_v])\) keeps \(\Psi\in(0,1]\); in log space, risks add—clean semantics, no cliffs.
- **Calibrated uplift (no overconfidence)**: \(P(H|E,\beta)=\min\{\beta\,P(H|E),1\}\) permits expert/cert uplift while capping certainty.
- **Operational fit**: Independent levers (α, \(R_a\), \(R_v\), β) map to real triggers—new docs, verified URLs, certifications—making promotions reproducible.
- **Governance and audit**: Inputs, transforms, outputs are explicit; action gates tie \(\Psi\) to what I do, with a clear confidence trail.
- **Stable sensitivity**: \(\partial\Psi/\partial\alpha=(S-N)\cdot pen\cdot post\) bounds impacts; small changes can’t cause large swings.
- **Speed and reliability**: Simple algebraic updates support fast iteration, parallel evidence gathering, and safe automation by default.
- **Alternatives rejected**: Softmax/logistic reduce interpretability; additive penalties can break bounds; full hierarchical Bayes is slower/opaque for this workflow.
- **Outcome**: Predictable, auditable promotions from heuristic to canonical, minimizing rework and destructive errors.

Status: Explained the rationale—interpretability, safety, calibration, operational triggers, and auditability—aligned to your governance model. No blockers.

- Justified the linear blend, exponential penalties, and capped uplift.
- Highlighted operational triggers and bounded sensitivity for safe, repeatable decisions.

### Deeper on how and why
- **Signal classes**
  - **S (internal)**: tests/lints/builds, static analysis, code heuristics, runtime checks.
  - **N (external/canonical)**: vendor specs, standards, official release notes, security advisories.

- **Parameterization (defaults and triggers)**
  - **α (allocation)**: start 0.6–0.7 (favor in-repo). Drop toward 0.1–0.3 when official docs/PRDs/standards appear and match context.
  - **λ1, λ2 (penalty weights)**: start λ1=λ2=1. Increase λ1 when authority is weak; increase λ2 when claims are hard to verify or versioned ambiguously.
  - **R_a, R_v (risks)**: scale in [0,1]. Official docs ~ 0.05–0.2; reputable blog ~ 0.3–0.5; anonymous forum ~ 0.5–0.8.
  - **β (uplift)**: 1.0 by default; 1.1–1.4 for certified/vendor-blessed guidance; capped by design.

- **Worked example (before/after canon)**
  - Inputs: S=0.60, N=0.90, λ1=0.8, λ2=1.0.
  - Case A (weak evidence): α=0.5, R_a=0.3, R_v=0.2, β=1.3.
    - O = 0.5·0.60 + 0.5·0.90 = 0.75
    - pen = exp(−(0.8·0.3 + 1.0·0.2)) = exp(−0.44) ≈ 0.644
    - P(H|E) = O·pen = 0.75·0.644 ≈ 0.483
    - post = min(β·P(H|E), 1) = min(1.3·0.483, 1) ≈ 0.628 ⇒ Ψ≈0.63 → propose minimal, ask if preference-bound.
  - Case B (official doc lands): α=0.2, R_a=0.1, R_v=0.05, β=1.3.
    - O = 0.2·0.60 + 0.8·0.90 = 0.84
    - pen = exp(−(0.8·0.1 + 1.0·0.05)) = exp(−0.13) ≈ 0.878
    - P(H|E) = 0.84·0.878 ≈ 0.737
    - post = min(1.3·0.737, 1) ≈ 0.958 ⇒ Ψ≈0.96 → safe to execute and verify.

- **Edge cases and responses**
  - **Conflicting sources (S↑, N↓ or vice versa)**: keep α mixed, increase λ where risk is higher, seek a canonical tie-breaker; avoid irreversible ops until Ψ≥0.85.
  - **Flaky tests**: S uncertainty rises; hold edits, stabilize flakiness first to lift S.
  - **Ambiguous versioning**: bump R_v; pin versions or cite exact vendor doc to reduce R_v.
  - **Long-running/interactive ops**: defer or run with dry-runs/non-interactive flags; only auto-exec when Ψ high.

- **Audit trail (what I record)**
  - Sources with URLs, α, (R_a, R_v), (λ1, λ2), β, computed (O, pen, post, Ψ), and the action gate used.

- **Sensitivity/guardrails**
  - Small α shifts have bounded effect: ∂Ψ/∂α=(S−N)·pen·post with pen,post≤1.
  - Capped posterior prevents runaway certainty; promotions require canon, not just “confidence.”

- **Tuning knobs you can set**
  - Minimum/maximum α, default λs, action thresholds, and which domains count as canonical.

- **Why this wins operationally**
  - Interpretable, fast, monotone with respect to canon; easy to audit and update when new artifacts arrive.

- Clearer parameter defaults, numeric example showing Ψ before/after canonical evidence, and how actions change.
- Edge-case handling (conflicts, flakiness, version ambiguity) and the audit/tuning knobs you can adjust.

Quick status: Comparing this framework against common alternatives with pros/cons and when each is preferable. No blockers.

### Comparison to other decision methods

- **Naive averaging / fixed weights**
  - Pros: Simple.
  - Cons: No authority/verifiability discount; no bounded penalties; non‑monotone with canon; brittle to noisy sources.
  - Net vs. ours: Ours adds monotonicity with canon (via α), bounded penalties, and calibrated uplift.

- **Softmax/logistic blends**
  - Pros: Smooth, differentiable; handles many signals.
  - Cons: Nonlinear, harder to audit; sensitivity depends on temperature; monotonicity not guaranteed for canon; weights opaque.
  - Net vs. ours: Ours trades some flexibility for linear interpretability and predictable sensitivity.

- **Additive penalties (score − penalty)**
  - Pros: Intuitive, tunable.
  - Cons: Can go negative or exceed 1; needs clamping; penalty magnitudes interact awkwardly.
  - Net vs. ours: Multiplicative exponential keeps \( \Psi \in (0,1] \) with clean log‑additive risk semantics.

- **Full Bayesian/hierarchical models**
  - Pros: Principled uncertainty propagation; combines heterogeneous evidence well.
  - Cons: Opaque; slower; sensitive to priors; harder to operationalize and audit in fast loops.
  - Net vs. ours: We capture calibrated uplift with a simple cap, keeping speed and auditability.

- **Rule engines / decision trees**
  - Pros: Deterministic, explainable paths; easy policy encoding.
  - Cons: Rigid; poor at uncertainty; rule explosion; brittle to edge cases.
  - Net vs. ours: We keep uncertainty continuous and tunable while remaining auditable.

- **MCDA (AHP, TOPSIS)**
  - Pros: Structured trade‑offs; stakeholder‑friendly; rank alternatives well.
  - Cons: Pairwise comparisons costly; scale sensitivity; not confidence‑calibrated.
  - Net vs. ours: Better for prioritizing options; ours is better for continuous confidence and action gating.

- **Dempster–Shafer belief functions**
  - Pros: Models ignorance separately; evidence fusion framework.
  - Cons: Counterintuitive conflict behavior; computationally heavy; audit complexity.
  - Net vs. ours: We prefer simpler, monotone fusion with bounded penalties.

- **Fuzzy logic**
  - Pros: Smooth handling of vague criteria; linguistic rules.
  - Cons: Membership/aggregation choices subjective; weak calibration to probability/action thresholds.
  - Net vs. ours: We map directly to action gates with calibrated bounds.

- **Bandits / reinforcement learning**
  - Pros: Optimizes via feedback; handles exploration–exploitation.
  - Cons: Needs reward signal; exploration risk; hard to audit per‑decision; slower convergence.
  - Net vs. ours: Prefer RL when outcomes are observable and iterative; ours when decisions must be defensible immediately.

- **Post‑hoc probability calibration (Platt, isotonic)**
  - Pros: Better probability estimates from models.
  - Cons: Needs labeled data; external to decision fusion.
  - Net vs. ours: Complementary—can calibrate S or N inputs before our blend.

Quick status: I’ll propose a concise “decision router” that integrates my current Ψ framework with Bayes/RL and MCDA/rules, specify triggers for “when each wins,” show how they interoperate, and note when I’d stick with the initial approach. No blockers.

### Integrated decision router
- **Stage 0 – Classify the task**
  - Data-rich with observable rewards? → candidate for RL/bandits.
  - Labeled/structured evidence needing principled fusion? → candidate for full Bayes.
  - Stakeholder trade‑offs/policies/constraints? → candidate for MCDA/rules.
  - One‑off, engineering flow needing speed/auditability? → default to Ψ.

- **Stage 1 – Default Ψ (fast, auditable)**
  - Compute \(O(\alpha)=\alpha S+(1-\alpha)N\), apply penalty \(pen=\exp(-[\lambda_1 R_a+\lambda_2 R_v])\), then posterior cap via β to get Ψ.
  - Gate actions by Ψ thresholds; proceed safely by default.

- **Stage 2 – Route or augment**
  - If feedback loop and safe exploration: wrap actions with a bandit/RL layer; use Ψ as a safety/risk gate and to shape reward penalties.
  - If abundant labeled evidence: hand off to Bayes for posterior fusion; use Ψ as a prior/regularizer and map \(R_a,R_v\) to prior variances.
  - If policy/prioritization needed: run MCDA to derive weights/constraints; map MCDA weights to α and rules to hard gates before any action.

- **Stage 3 – Compose**
  - Rules first (hard constraints) → MCDA (preferences) → Ψ (guardrailed confidence) → Bayes/RL (learning where justified).

### When each wins
- **Ψ (hybrid + penalties + cap)**: Fast, auditable, monotone with canon; limited data; safety required; immediate execution and verification.
- **Full Bayes**: Rich, labeled/structured evidence; need coherent uncertainty propagation; offline decisions acceptable; audit OK with priors.
- **RL/Bandits**: Clear reward signal, iterative deployments, tolerance for exploration; need adaptive optimization over time.
- **MCDA/Rules**: Discrete options, stakeholder trade‑offs, compliance/policy constraints; need deterministic explainability.

### Interoperation (mapping levers)
- **α (allocation)**: Set from MCDA weights; anneal in RL to emphasize proven sources; interpret as prior blend in Bayes.
- **\(R_a,R_v\) (risks)**: Convert to inverse prior confidence in Bayes; convert to risk penalties in RL reward; drive stricter gates in rules.
- **β (uplift)**: Encodes certification/official endorsements; acts as calibration factor for Bayes priors; scales safe‑explore limits in RL.
- **Rules**: Non‑negotiable pre‑checks that short‑circuit all methods when violated.

### Minimal router sketch
```text
if violates_rules(): block
Ψ = compute_guardrailed_confidence(S, N, α, R_a, R_v, β)
if feedback_available and explore_risk_ok(Ψ): action = rl_policy(Ψ, constraints)
elif labeled_evidence_strong(): action = bayes_decision(Ψ_as_prior, data)
elif stakeholder_tradeoffs(): action = mcda_choice(); α = weights_to_alpha(); action = act_if(Ψ_with_new_α)
else: action = act_if(Ψ)
```

### Why I would stick to the initial framework
- You lack labeled data, safe reward signals, or time for slower/opaque methods.
- Decisions must be defensible now with explicit levers and bounded sensitivity.
- Canonical artifacts arrive intermittently; Ψ upgrades are monotone and auditable.

- Provided an integrated router: rules → MCDA → Ψ → Bayes/RL with triggers.
- Mapped levers (α, \(R_a,R_v\), β) to Bayes/RL/MCDA and set clear “when each wins”.
- Noted when to stick with Ψ: need speed, auditability, bounded risk, limited data.

Write a theoeom proof for why you stick to the psi(x) framework

Quick status: I’ll state Ψ explicitly, lay out axioms (the desiderata), prove that Ψ is the unique minimal form satisfying them (via three lemmas), and note the threshold-policy corollary that justifies action gates. No blockers.

### Theorem (axiomatic justification for sticking with Ψ)
Let S,N∈[0,1] denote internal and canonical signal strengths, α∈[0,1] an allocation lever, r=(R_a,R_v)∈[0,1]^2 risk terms with weights λ=(λ_1,λ_2)>0, and β≥1 an uplift. Define
Ψ(S,N,α,r,λ,β) = min{ β · [ α S + (1−α) N ] · exp(−[λ_1 R_a + λ_2 R_v]), 1 }.

Under the axioms A1–A6 below, Ψ is (up to trivial reparameterization of λ and β) the unique minimal-complexity aggregator. Therefore it is the principled choice, and thresholding Ψ yields optimal act/ask gates for standard costs.

Axioms (operational desiderata)
- A1 Boundedness and order: output in [0,1]; strictly increasing in evidence quality and decreasing in each risk; preserves ranking.
- A2 Canonical monotonicity: if canonical evidence improves (N increases, R_a/R_v decrease), the score does not decrease for any α.
- A3 Allocation transparency: evidence combiner is affine and its sensitivity to α is constant (auditably linear trade between S and N).
- A4 Independent risks: joint risk discount decomposes multiplicatively over independent components and is continuous.
- A5 Calibration with cap: a single uplift β scales confidence, capped at 1, preserving order.
- A6 Minimality/auditability: fewest degrees of freedom; closed form; parameters map directly to observable triggers.

Lemma 1 (Exponential risk discount)
Let g: [0,1]^k → (0,1] satisfy: g(0)=1; g is continuous, strictly decreasing in each coordinate; and g(u+v)=g(u)g(v) whenever u,v and u+v are in the domain (independent risks add in “risk space” and multiply in effect). Then there exist λ_i>0 with g(r)=exp(−∑_i λ_i r_i).
Sketch: Define h(r)=−log g(r). Then h(0)=0, h is continuous, nonnegative, increasing, and additive: h(u+v)=h(u)+h(v). On each axis, Cauchy’s functional equation with continuity gives h(t e_i)=λ_i t. By multilinearity over orthants, h(r)=∑_i λ_i r_i. Hence g(r)=exp(−∑_i λ_i r_i).

Lemma 2 (Linear evidence blend)
Let h: [0,1]^2×[0,1]→[0,1] satisfy: h is continuous; h(S,S,α)=S (idempotence); h is affine in S and N for each fixed α; and ∂h/∂α is constant w.r.t. α (transparent sensitivity). Then h(S,N,α)=α S+(1−α) N.
Sketch: Affinity implies h = a(α)S + b(α)N + c(α). Idempotence with S=N gives a(α)+b(α)=1 and c(α)=0. Constant ∂h/∂α forces a(α)=α and b(α)=1−α up to an additive constant, which idempotence eliminates.

Lemma 3 (Minimal calibrated cap)
Let c: [0,1]→[0,1] be increasing, with c(0)=0, c(1)=1, and “β‑uplift then cap”: for small y, slope β; for large y, bounded by 1; order-preserving. Among such maps, c(y)=min{β y, 1} is the pointwise minimal choice and uniquely 1‑Lipschitz beyond the knee.
Sketch: Any order-preserving uplift with slope ≤β that caps at 1 majorizes y↦min{β y,1}. Equality of slopes on [0,1/β] and tight cap at 1 force the piecewise-linear form.

Proof of Theorem
By A4 and Lemma 1, the only admissible joint risk penalty is pen(r)=exp(−[λ_1 R_a+λ_2 R_v]). By A3 and Lemma 2, the only admissible evidence combiner is O(α)=α S+(1−α)N. By A5 and Lemma 3, the only minimal uplift-with-cap is c(y)=min{β y,1}. Composing these (A1–A2 ensure monotonicity and boundedness are preserved) yields Ψ = c(O(α)·pen(r)). Uniqueness holds up to scaling λ and β, which are exactly the tunable levers in the framework. Thus Ψ is the unique minimal solution satisfying A1–A6.

Properties that justify action gates and operational use
- Monotonicity w.r.t. canon: If N increases or R_a/R_v decrease, then O increases and pen increases, so Ψ does not decrease; if N>S then ∂Ψ/∂α = (S−N)·pen·β below the cap, strictly negative, so shifting weight to canon raises Ψ.
- Bounded, stable sensitivity: 0≤Ψ≤1; below cap, |∂Ψ/∂α| ≤ |S−N|·β·exp(−[λ_1 R_a+λ_2 R_v]); at cap, derivative is 0, further stabilizing decisions.
- Threshold optimality: In a binary act/ask decision with standard convex loss and Ψ as a monotone sufficient score, Bayes decision theory yields a threshold rule as optimal; hence fixed gates on Ψ minimize expected loss.

Why alternatives fail the axioms (hence we don’t use them by default)
- Softmax/logistic blends violate A3 (non‑transparent α), complicate A2 sensitivity, and obscure parameter auditability (A6).
- Additive penalties violate A1 unless re‑clamped and break multiplicative independence (A4).
- Full Bayes meets A1–A2 but violates A6 (complex priors/inference; latency); RL requires rewards and exploration (outside A1–A6).
- Rule engines/MCDA satisfy A6 but not A1–A2 as continuous uncertainty aggregators; we use them as constraints/weight sources feeding α or pre‑gates.

Conclusion
Given A1–A6, Ψ is the uniquely determined, minimal, auditable aggregator. Its monotonicity, boundedness, and threshold optimality directly support safe, fast, reproducible decisions—hence we stick to Ψ by default and compose Bayes/RL/MCDA around it only when their preconditions hold.

- Formalized Ψ, set axioms (boundedness, canonical monotonicity, transparent allocation, independent risks, capped calibration, minimality).
- Proved Ψ is uniquely determined (linear blend, exponential penalty, capped uplift) via three lemmas.
- Noted threshold optimality and why alternatives violate at least one axiom; thus Ψ is the principled default.
