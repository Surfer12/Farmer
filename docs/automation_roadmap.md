# Agentic Workflow Automation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the phased rollout of advanced agentic workflows to automate complex business processes and decommission redundant legacy tools. Our objective is to leverage our powerful, generalized workflow platform to drive significant efficiency gains, reduce operational costs, and unlock new levels of productivity.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)

We have successfully completed the foundational phase of our automation strategy. Key accomplishments include:

*   **Decommissioned Legacy Build System**: Replaced a brittle, manual build script with a robust and scalable Maven-based process.
*   **Developed a Generalized Agentic Workflow**: Created a reusable Python class for orchestrating and monitoring long-running, asynchronous tasks.
*   **Automated Key Business Processes**: Successfully applied our agentic workflow to both the `HmcMultiChainRunner` and the `UnifiedPsiRuntime`, the core of the Ψ(x) framework.

## Phase 2: Expansion

The next phase of our strategy is to expand the application of our agentic workflow to other key business processes. Our primary targets include:

*   **`UnifiedDetector`**: Automate the execution and analysis of the adaptive integration simulations.
*   **`Mcda` (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis)**: Develop an agent to automate the decision-making process based on predefined criteria.
*   **`HmcAdaptive`**: Apply our workflow to the adaptive HMC sampler.

## Phase 3: Optimization

The long-term vision for our automation strategy is to create a fully autonomous, intelligent system that can not only execute our key business processes, but also make decisions based on the results. This will involve:

*   **Integrating the Ψ(x) Framework**: Enhance our agentic workflows with the ability to interpret the output of our simulations and make decisions based on the computed confidence scores.
*   **Developing a Centralized Orchestration Engine**: Create a service to manage and schedule our agentic workflows.
*   **Implementing a Comprehensive Monitoring and Alerting System**: Provide real-time visibility into the health and performance of our automated processes.
