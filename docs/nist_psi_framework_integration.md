# NIST Cybersecurity Framework Integration with Ψ(x)

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive three-phase integration of the Ψ(x) confidence framework with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, providing quantitative rigor to cybersecurity assessments while maintaining full compatibility with established NIST practices.

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Quantitative Measure Function Enhancement
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Mathematical Threshold Governance  
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Sector-Specific Profile Development

## Technical Foundation

### The Ψ(x) Framework
The Ψ(x) framework provides a mathematically principled approach to confidence quantification:

```
Ψ(x) = min{β · O(α) · pen(x), 1}
```

Where:
- **O(α) = αS + (1-α)N**: Evidence blend (source vs non-source)
- **pen(x) = exp(-[λ₁Ra + λ₂Rv])**: Risk penalty function
- **β**: Regulatory/canonical evidence uplift factor

### NIST CSF 2.0 Integration Points

| NIST Component | Ψ(x) Mapping | Implementation |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Technical Characteristics | S, N parameters | Evidence strength assessment |
| Socio-technical Risks | Ra, Rv factors | Authority & verifiability risks |
| Regulatory Evidence | β multipliers | Canonical source weighting |
| Implementation Tiers | Parameter adjustments | Maturity-based calibration |
| Outcome Status | Confidence levels | Achievement measurement |

## Phase 1: Measure Function Enhancement

### Objective
Implement Ψ(x) as a quantitative metric within NIST's Measure function, providing mathematical rigor to cybersecurity posture assessment.

### Implementation Architecture

```python
class NISTMeasureFunction:
    def __init__(self):
        self.technical_characteristics: List[TechnicalCharacteristic] = []
        self.socio_technical_risks: List[SocioTechnicalRisk] = []
        self.regulatory_evidence: List[RegulatoryEvidence] = []
        
    def measure_psi(self, alpha: float = 0.7) -> PsiMeasurement:
        # Compute Ψ(x) with full audit trail
```

### Key Features

1. **Technical Characteristics Mapping**
   - Maps cybersecurity controls to S (source evidence) and N (non-source evidence) parameters
   - Weighted aggregation based on confidence levels
   - Category-based organization (Cryptographic Controls, Identity Management, etc.)

2. **Socio-technical Risk Assessment**
   - Converts organizational risks to Ra (authority risk) and Rv (verifiability risk)
   - Risk categories: Technical, Operational, Regulatory, Reputational
   - Likelihood-weighted aggregation

3. **Regulatory Evidence Integration**
   - β parameter weighting for canonical sources (NIST SP 800-53, industry standards)
   - Time-based validity checking with expiration dates
   - Authority level classification (CANONICAL, EXPERT, COMMUNITY)

### Demonstration Results

```
Ψ(x) = 0.626 (Low confidence)
Audit Trail:
• Evidence blend O(α=0.700) = 0.906
• Penalty function pen = 0.461
• Beta weight β = 1.500
• Ψ(x) = min{0.626, 1} = 0.626
```

## Phase 2: Threshold Governance

### Objective
Apply threshold transfer principles to NIST governance requirements, ensuring mathematical consistency for risk tolerance changes with complete audit trails.

### Mathematical Foundation

**Threshold Transfer Principle**: When β parameter changes from β to β', adjust threshold as:
```
τ' = τ · (β/β')
```

This preserves decision consistency in the sub-cap region while maintaining monotonic behavior.

### Implementation Features

1. **Dynamic Threshold Management**
   - Context-specific thresholds (critical_infrastructure, business_operations, etc.)
   - Justification tracking for all threshold changes
   - Timestamp-based audit trail

2. **Cross-organizational Harmonization**
   - Threshold alignment across organizational units
   - Consistent risk tolerance application
   - Change propagation with full traceability

3. **Mathematical Consistency**
   - Automatic threshold adjustment under β parameter changes
   - Preservation of accept/reject decision sets
   - Sensitivity invariant maintenance

### Governance Capabilities

```python
class NISTThresholdGovernance:
    def transfer_threshold(self, context: str, old_beta: float, new_beta: float) -> float:
        # Apply τ' = τ·β/β' transformation
        
    def harmonize_thresholds(self, contexts: List[str], target_context: str) -> Dict[str, float]:
        # Align thresholds across organizational contexts
```

### Demonstration Results

```
Threshold transfer: 1.5 → 1.8, new threshold: 0.750
Harmonized thresholds: {'business_operations': 0.75}
Complete audit trail with timestamps and justifications
```

## Phase 3: Profile Development

### Objective
Create sector-specific profiles using Ψ(x) parameterizations, enabling tailored cybersecurity assessments for different industries and regulatory environments.

### Healthcare Profile

**Regulatory Focus**: FDA-approved methods, HIPAA compliance, patient safety

```python
healthcare_profile = {
    'parameters': {
        'default_alpha': 0.8,        # High weight on authoritative sources
        'lambda1': 0.5,              # Lower authority risk sensitivity
        'lambda2': 1.2,              # Higher verifiability risk sensitivity
        'beta_weights': {
            'FDA_approved': 1.8,
            'HIPAA_compliant': 1.5,
            'clinical_guidelines': 1.3
        }
    },
    'thresholds': {
        'patient_critical': 0.95,
        'privacy_sensitive': 0.90,
        'operational': 0.75
    }
}
```

### Finance Profile

**Regulatory Focus**: Regulatory compliance, financial materiality, reputation management

```python
finance_profile = {
    'parameters': {
        'default_alpha': 0.9,        # Very high weight on regulatory sources
        'lambda1': 2.0,              # High authority risk sensitivity
        'lambda2': 0.8,              # Moderate verifiability risk sensitivity
        'beta_weights': {
            'regulatory_mandate': 2.0,
            'industry_regulation': 1.7,
            'best_practice': 1.2
        }
    },
    'thresholds': {
        'regulatory_critical': 0.98,
        'financial_material': 0.92,
        'customer_facing': 0.85
    }
}
```
