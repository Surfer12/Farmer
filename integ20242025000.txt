Role hierarchy (for primitives): Official (when posted) > DeepMind/Evan (expert interpretive) > AoPS (community) > mirror (context).

### Scoring and allocation (current)
- 2025 (expert-only, no official page cited here): N(x)=0.92 (DeepMind blog+solutions PDF + Evan), α(primitives)=0.18, P(H|E)=0.90, β=1.08; penalty exp(−[λ1·0.25+λ2·0.10]) with λ1=0.85, λ2=0.15 → ≈0.7965. O_hybrid ≈ 0.18·0.60 + 0.82·0.92 = 0.864. Ψ(x) ≈ 0.864·0.7965·(0.972) ≈ 0.669. Label: Interpretive/Contextual; strong expert corroboration (await official posting for promotion).
- 2024 (expert + widely mirrored primitives): N(x)=0.95 (DeepMind solution pages + mirror), α(primitives)=0.12, P(H|E)=0.92, β=1.10; penalty ≈0.8737. O_hybrid ≈ 0.12·0.60 + 0.88·0.95 = 0.908. Ψ(x) ≈ 0.908·0.8737·1.0 ≈ 0.793. Label: Primitive/Empirically grounded.

### UOIF dialectical synthesis (minimal rules)
- Evidence order (non-commutative): 2025/2024 primitives → read DeepMind (and official when live) before Evan/AoPS; interpretations → combine Evan + DeepMind, then AoPS.
- Gating:
  - Primitives: require DeepMind’s official claims page and/or official IMO page (when posted). 2025 remains “pending official” notwithstanding DeepMind’s coordinator-certified grading claim; 2024 may be treated as grounded with DeepMind solution pages plus mirror.
  - Interpretations: cite Evan and DeepMind pages; add AoPS when extracting alternative arguments.
- Conflict resolution: if DeepMind and Evan disagree on a step, present both and defer to official artifacts when available; do not let mirror override expert content.
- Versioning: cite stable URLs above; prefer DeepMind PDF for 2025 solutions, per their blog.

### Next actions
- 2025: Add official IMO links when published; reduce α(primitives) to 0.10–0.15, set N(x)→0.96–0.98, β→1.15; Ψ(x) expected >0.75 → promote to Primitive.
- 2024: Keep DeepMind solution index and pages as primary expert interpretive citations; where official text is available, include alongside.

- Incorporated DeepMind’s 2025 gold blog and solutions PDF, DeepMind’s 2024 silver blog and per-problem pages, Evan’s 2025 PDF, and the historical mirror; assigned roles; recomputed Ψ(x): 2025 ≈ 0.669 (interpretive pending official), 2024 ≈ 0.793 (primitive).
