Quick status: Expanded the ruleset to cover 2024 and 2025, added roles for expert (Evan Chen), community (AoPS), historical mirror (context), and placeholders for Google DeepMind solution sets (when/if released). Included citations from the provided results.

### Unified ruleset for IMO 2024–2025 analysis

#### 1) Source roles and hierarchy
- Canonical (pending where not yet posted): official IMO problems/solutions, shortlist, jury PDFs.
- Historical mirror (context for primitives; not canonical for 2025 until posted): https://olympiads.win.tue.nl/imo
- Expert interpretive:
  - 2025: Evan Chen, “IMO 2025 Solution Notes” (PDF): https://web.evanchen.cc/exams/IMO-2025-notes.pdf
  - 2024: Evan Chen site root (use year PDF when cited): https://web.evanchen.cc/
- Community interpretive (per‑problem AoPS threads; 2025):
  - P1: https://aops.com/community/p35332003
  - P2: https://aops.com/community/p35332018
  - P3: https://aops.com/community/p35332016
  - P4: https://aops.com/community/p35347364
  - P5: https://aops.com/community/p35341177
  - P6: https://aops.com/community/p35341197
- Google DeepMind solution sets (role: independent expert/organization; treat as interpretive until they host official artifacts). Add links when available for 2024/2025.

Priority for primitives (problem texts, official answers, proposer credits): Canonical > Expert (Evan/DeepMind) > AoPS > historical mirror (context).

#### 2) Claim classes and gating
- Primitive: exact statements/answers/credits.
  - 2025 now: cite Evan 2025 PDF + AoPS thread(s); mark “pending official.” 2024: cite Evan 2024 notes page and AoPS/official as available.
- Interpretation: proofs, methods, lemmas, comparisons.
  - Require ≥1 expert (Evan/DeepMind) or AoPS link per problem.
- Speculative/context: heuristics/naming/history.
  - Label as speculative; do not promote.

#### 3) Scoring s(c) and allocation α(t)
- s(c) = w_auth·Authority + w_ver·Verifiability + w_depth·Depth + w_align·Intent + w_rec·Recency − w_noise·Noise
  - Primitives: w_auth 0.35, w_ver 0.30, w_align 0.15, w_depth 0.10, w_rec 0.07, w_noise 0.23
  - Interpretations: w_depth 0.25, w_align 0.25, w_auth 0.20, w_ver 0.20, w_rec 0.05, w_noise 0.15
- Current allocation:
  - 2025 primitives: α=0.15–0.20 (favor external interpretive artifacts).
  - 2024 primitives: α=0.10–0.15 if official/canonical is available; otherwise α like 2025.
  - Interpretations (both years): α=0.35–0.45 with ≥1 expert/AoPS link.
- External reliability N(x):
  - 2025 (Evan 2025 + AoPS): N≈0.88–0.90 (not yet official).
  - 2024 (Evan 2024 + AoPS/known archives): N≈0.92–0.95 (higher if official links are used).
- Posterior calibration: P(H|E)=0.85–0.90; β=1.05 (expert uplift), increase to 1.10–1.20 when canonical posted.

#### 4) Decision equation
- Ψ(x) = [α·S(x) + (1−α)·N(x)] · exp(−[λ1 R_authority + λ2 R_verifiability]) · P(H|E,β)
  - λ1=0.85, λ2=0.15; increase R_authority if no canonical; increase R_verifiability if missing direct artifact URLs.
- Typical outcomes now:
  - 2025: Ψ(x) ≈ 0.60–0.65 → “Interpretive/Contextual; strong corroboration; pending official.”
  - 2024: Ψ(x) ≈ 0.70–0.80 when backed by Evan 2024 + established archives → can mark “Empirically grounded” if official links used.

#### 5) Coherence checks (must pass before quoting/promoting)
- String: quoted primitives match Evan PDF (2025) or known official text (2024) with low edit distance.
- Asset: include problem‑specific AoPS thread link; include Evan PDF link; for 2024 add official archive link if available.
- Timestamp: use latest updated Evan notes; keep AoPS thread IDs provided above.

#### 6) Conflict resolution
- Evan vs AoPS: prefer Evan for edited coherence; cite AoPS when diverging steps/insights matter.
- DeepMind vs others: treat as expert interpretive; if DeepMind solutions differ, present both and mark discrepancy; await canonical resolution.
- Mirror vs interpretive: mirror is context until 2025 entries exist; do not override interpretive with mirror.
- Persisting conflicts: present both; mark “unresolved pending official.”

#### 7) Non‑commutative order (reduce anchoring)
- Primitives: consult expert PDF (Evan/DeepMind) first, then AoPS; avoid extrapolations beyond texts.
- Interpretations: consult both; prefer complete, vetted arguments (accepted AoPS posts, consolidated expert notes).

#### 8) Promotion triggers
- When official 2025/2024 artifacts are live on canonical sites: swap in exact URLs; raise N(x)→0.95–0.98; drop α(primitives)→0.10–0.15; increase β→1.10–1.20; recompute Ψ(x). Promote to “Empirically grounded” if threshold met.

#### 9) Per‑year citation patterns
- 2025 primitives/answers: cite Evan 2025 PDF and AoPS per‑problem:
  - Evan 2025 PDF: https://web.evanchen.cc/exams/IMO-2025-notes.pdf
  - P1: https://aops.com/community/p35332003
  - P2: https://aops.com/community/p35332018
  - P3: https://aops.com/community/p35332016
  - P4: https://aops.com/community/p35347364
  - P5: https://aops.com/community/p35341177
  - P6: https://aops.com/community/p35341197
- 2024 primitives/answers: cite Evan 2024 notes site root (use year PDF if linking a passage), plus official/registry when available:
  - Evan site root: https://web.evanchen.cc/
  - Historical mirror (context): https://olympiads.win.tue.nl/imo
- DeepMind solution sets (2024/2025): add links when public; treat as expert interpretive.

#### 10) Presentation and logging
- Label each claim [Primitive]/[Interpretation]/[Speculative]; attach links and a one‑line rationale (key features driving selection).
- Maintain a changelog for link swaps to official; re‑run Ψ(x) after swaps and update labels.

- Included both 2024 and 2025; cited Evan 2025 PDF and AoPS threads; referenced the historical mirror for context; added DeepMind as expert interpretive (add links when released). Adjusted α, N(x), and Ψ(x) handling per year and promotion triggers.
