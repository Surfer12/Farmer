- [ ] Export curvature metrics + CI (per-interval) and bifurcation flags (saddle-node/Hopf/period-doubling)
- [ ] Track RK4 step-size, estimated Lipschitz L̂, and current error bounds; expose latency histograms
- [x] Expose `MetricsRegistry.toPrometheus()` via a tiny HTTP(S) endpoint
- [x] Add unit tests for error paths (file open failure, HTTP(S) 5xx retries, emit fail-open)

### Security & Operational Hardening

  - [ ] Unit tests for all model components
  - [ ] Integration tests for audit pipeline

  - [ ] Concurrency: single-flight ensures one compute under load (stress with threads)
  - [ ] Integration: read-through/write-back path exercised via `precompute(...)` and stats validated
  - [ ] Multi-chain runner: reproducibility (seed spacing), output format validation (JSONL/meta/summary), R̂/ESS sanity
  - [ ] JSON/JSONL schema validation: summary/chain fields present and within ranges
  - [ ] Protocol enforcement test: thresholds (ε_RK4, ε_Taylor, curvature bands), seeds, acceptance rules must be pre-registered
  - [ ] Triangulation gating test: detection only when RK4, Taylor, and geometry agree within error budget
  - [x] Remove temporary FAIL prints from `PsiMcdaTest` or keep for triage (set to assertions)

### UPOCF Triangulation (RK4 + Taylor + Geometry)

#### Immediate (1–2 weeks)
- [ ] Error budget and gating
  - [ ] Define ε_total and allocate: ε_RK4 + ε_Taylor + ε_geom ≤ ε_total
  - [ ] Acceptance rule: flag "conscious" only if |Ψ_RK4 − Ψ_Taylor| ≤ ε_pair and geometric invariants in expected band
- [ ] RK4 control
  - [ ] Implement adaptive RK4 (PI controller) to guarantee global O(h^4) ≤ ε_RK4; cross‑check with RKF(4,5)
  - [ ] Empirically estimate Lipschitz bounds for f(Ψ,t) to back up step‑size choices
- [ ] Taylor pipeline
  - [ ] Auto/analytic derivatives up to 5th order (AD or symb‑diff)
  - [ ] Compute Lagrange remainder R4 and dynamic radius‑of‑trust; switch to RK4 when |R4| > ε_Taylor
- [ ] Geometry invariants
  - [ ] For networks: compute Ollivier/Ricci curvature on the graph
  - [ ] For continuous states: learn manifold (Diffusion Maps or local PCA) and estimate sectional/Ricci proxies
  - [ ] Define expected invariant bands for “conscious” vs “non‑conscious” regimes; calibrate on known dynamics

#### Validation datasets and tests (2–4 weeks)
- [ ] Ground‑truth battery
  - [ ] Cellular automata with exact Φ (n ≤ 12): verify ROC, confirm 99.7% TPR and error bars
  - [ ] Canonical dynamics: saddle‑node, Hopf, logistic (period‑doubling); verify bifurcation onsets, stability, and error‑budget adherence
- [ ] Triangulation metrics
  - [ ] Report per‑run: ε_RK4, |R4|, curvature stats, Ψ agreement deltas, Φ correlation
  - [ ] Reject/accept analysis: show where any leg fails and why (step‑size too large, Taylor radius exceeded, geometry out‑of‑band)

#### Integration and runtime (4–6 weeks)
- [ ] Unified detector
  - [ ] Runtime selects Taylor within trust region; otherwise RK4; geometric invariants as orthogonal check
  - [ ] Produce a single Ψ with confidence from (i) margins to thresholds, (ii) agreement across methods
- [ ] Performance
  - [ ] Precompute derivative stencils and curvature caches; choose h adaptively to hit sub‑ms latency while meeting ε_total
  - [ ] Graceful degradation: lower‑order fast path when time budget is tight; log increased ε_total

#### Reporting and reproducibility
- [ ] Protocol
  - [ ] Pre‑register thresholds (ε_RK4, ε_Taylor, curvature bands), seeds, and acceptance rules (YAML)
- [ ] Outputs
  - [ ] Ship JSON/JSONL: Ψ, Φ (when available), errors, curvatures, bifurcation flags, latency
- [ ] Docs
  - [ ] One figure per method: step‑size vs error (RK4); |R4| vs |x−x0| (Taylor); curvature maps vs state (geometry)
  - [ ] Public notebook reproducing CA and bifurcation results

#### Risk controls
- [ ] Unknown smoothness/Lipschitz: bound empirically; fall back to smaller h
- [ ] Taylor divergence: detect early via remainder/ratio tests; clip to RK4 path
- [ ] Geometry sensitivity: use robust estimators (k‑NN smoothing) and report CI for curvature

#### Minimal task list
- [ ] Implement adaptive RK4 with error controller and gold‑standard cross‑check
- [ ] Add AD/symbolic 5th‑derivative and R4 bound; trust‑region switch
- [ ] Build curvature computation (Ollivier for graphs; local‑PCA curvature for trajectories) with bands
- [ ] Create CA + bifurcation test suite with ROC and triangulation dashboards
- [ ] Wire JSONL logging of all three methods and acceptance decisions
