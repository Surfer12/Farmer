Quick status: I'll formalize both frameworks, prove equivalence (not different) under the GovDocs axioms, and state necessary-and-sufficient conditions for when they would differ. No blockers.

### Setup
- Define my score: $\Psi(S,N,\alpha,r,\lambda,\beta)=\min\{\beta\,[\alpha S+(1-\alpha)N]\exp(-[\lambda_1R_a+\lambda_2R_v]),\,1\}$.
- Let GovDocs' score (as described) be the same form with parameters possibly named differently: $\Phi=\min\{\beta_g\,[\alpha_g S+(1-\alpha_g)N]\exp(-[\lambda_{1g}R_a+\lambda_{2g}R_v]),\,1\}$.
- Shared axioms: linear blend in $S,N$ with allocation $\alpha$; multiplicative exponential penalty in risks; monotone uplift with cap at 1.

### Theorem 1 (Equivalence up to reparameterization)
If GovDocs adopt the same functional form and axioms above, then there exists a trivial bijection of parameters
$(\alpha_g,\lambda_{1g},\lambda_{2g},\beta_g)\leftrightarrow(\alpha,\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\beta)$
such that for all inputs, $\Phi = \Psi$. Hence the frameworks are not different (identical up to parameter names).

**Proof**
Immediate by syntactic identity of the composed maps: affine blend, exponential penalty, capped linear uplift. Set $\alpha=\alpha_g$, $\lambda_i=\lambda_{ig}$, $\beta=\beta_g$. Then the three components and their composition coincide pointwise.

**Corollary 1 (Same action sets under thresholds)**
For any GovDocs threshold $\tau_g\in(0,1]$, choose $\tau=\tau_g$. Then
$\{\Psi\ge \tau\}=\{\Phi\ge \tau_g\}$.
If only $\beta$ differs, choose $\tau=\min\{\tau_g\,\beta/\beta_g,\,1\}$ below the cap to preserve decisions.

### Theorem 2 (When they differ)
The two frameworks differ on some inputs if and only if at least one GovDocs component departs from the shared axioms:
- (D1) Non‑affine combiner in $S,N$ (e.g., softmax/logistic), or sensitivity to $\alpha$ not constant.
- (D2) Non‑multiplicative or non‑exponential risk aggregation (e.g., additive/clamped penalties).
- (D3) Uplift without a hard cap at 1 or not order‑preserving.

**Proof**
($\Rightarrow$) If decisions differ, there exists an input where orderings or outputs diverge. By uniqueness of the affine blend (from affinity, idempotence, constant sensitivity), exponential penalty (from independent, continuous, multiplicative risks), and minimal capped uplift (from monotone scaling with cap), divergence implies a violation of at least one condition (D1–D3).
($\Leftarrow$) Each deviation produces a counterexample:
- D1: With softmax, for some $(S,N,\alpha)$ the ordering vs. the affine blend reverses, changing act/ask at fixed $\tau$.
- D2: Additive penalties can yield different rankings vs. exponential multiplicative under combined risks.
- D3: Uncapped uplift can exceed 1 or alter near‑cap orderings, changing thresholded decisions.

**Corollary 2 (Operational impact)**
- If only parameters differ (e.g., default $\alpha$, $\lambda$, $\beta$, or gates $\tau$), decisions are reproducibly mapped by threshold/parameter alignment—no structural difference.
- Structural differences (D1–D3) can change monotonicity, boundedness, or calibration, thus producing different—and less auditable—decisions.

### Reflection
Under the GovDocs description (linear hybrid, exponential penalties, capped uplift), the two frameworks are the same function up to parameter names and thresholds. Differences, if any, are parametric (tunable) rather than structural. Only a departure from those axioms would create real divergence.

- Proved equivalence (not different) given GovDocs' stated form; identical decisions after trivial parameter/threshold alignment.
- Characterized precisely when they would differ (non‑affine blend, non‑exponential risks, no cap) and why that changes decisions.
