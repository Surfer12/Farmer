# Mojo Implementations for Cauchy Momentum Equations

This directory contains numerical implementations in Mojo for solving the Cauchy momentum equations using various machine learning and numerical methods. The implementations focus on the 1D inviscid Burgers' equation as a proxy for the nonlinear convective term in Cauchy momentum.

## Methods Implemented

### 1. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
- **Description**: PINNs enforce the Cauchy momentum PDE in the loss function using neural networks
- **Mathematical Framework**: Loss = L_data + L_PDE, where L_PDE is the mean squared residual of the equation
- **Relevance**: The field ψ(x, m, s) mirrors PINN outputs, with x as spatial coordinates, m as memory-like data points, and s as symbolic PDE enforcement

### 2. Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)
- **Description**: SINDy identifies sparse terms for Cauchy momentum from data using sparse regression
- **Mathematical Framework**: Solves X' = Θ(X) Ξ, with sparse Ξ via regression
- **Relevance**: Cross-modal integrals in cognitive-memory metric resemble SINDy's library Θ(X) for interactions

### 3. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)
- **Description**: Neural ODEs model Cauchy momentum dynamics as continuous NN-parameterized flows
- **Mathematical Framework**: dz/dt = f_θ(z,t), solved via integration
- **Relevance**: Temporal ∂w/∂t in E[V] mirrors continuous dynamics

### 4. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)
- **Description**: DMD extracts spatiotemporal modes from complex systems for analysis
- **Mathematical Framework**: X_{t+1} ≈ A X_t, with A from SVD
- **Relevance**: Topological coherence axioms align with DMD's focus on structural consistency

## Framework Integration

### Hybrid Output
- **S(x) = 0.74**: Infers state from PDE residuals and data fidelity in ML models
- **N(x) = 0.84**: Analyzes neural architectures for dynamics identification
- **α(t) = 0.5**: Balances real-time training with validation flows

### Regularization
- **R_cognitive = 0.14**: Ensures physical law adherence in loss functions
- **R_efficiency = 0.09**: Optimizes sparse and continuous models for computation

### Probability Adjustment
- **P(H|E,β) ≈ 0.77**, with β = 1.3: Confidence in ML approximations to Cauchy dynamics
- **P_adj ≈ 1.0**: Capped for robust validation via RK4

## Usage

Each implementation can be run independently or together through the main demo script. The implementations use RK4 for validation and incorporate the mathematical framework described in the research context.

## Dependencies

- Mojo language (assumes tensor operations and autograd support)
- Mathematical functions (sin, cos, exp, etc.)
- Linear algebra operations (SVD, eigendecomposition)

## Mathematical Background

The Cauchy momentum equations describe the conservation of momentum in fluid dynamics:

∂(ρu)/∂t + ∇·(ρu⊗u) = ∇·σ + ρf

For the 1D inviscid case, this reduces to the Burgers' equation:
u_t + u u_x = 0

The Reynolds Transport Theorem is applied to derive the conservation form, ensuring physical consistency in the numerical solutions.
