Generating LaTeX code
I'm working on producing LaTeX file content. I see the developer instructions focus on outputting code rather than editing a repository. It seems it's best to present the LaTeX code in a fenced code block without needing to write directly to a file on the user's system. I will provide a brief update to clarify the process and include the UOIF formula for two scenarios in 2025 and 2024, showing computations step-by-step with confidence measures.
Presenting computations
I'm planning to provide computations with step-by-step confidence measures. I'll make sure the chat text is concise, though the code block could be lengthy. Since a LaTeX document is considered code, I’ll format it using triple backticks with the "latex" language tag. I need to ensure I don’t wrap the entire message in a code block—just the LaTeX. Also, I’ll include attribution notes to credit the correct sources, like Raissi et al. for PINNs and others for related works.
Addressing user claims
I need to handle the claims attributed to Ryan David Oates carefully, as I can't verify them and must avoid presenting false information. I’ll summarize the user’s requested claims as "user-supplied claims" and set these at a low confidence level, labeling them as "Speculative" in the document. I plan to provide a confidence measure for each claim, like “Confidence that Oates pioneered PINNs: 0.05.” Additionally, I should include a "Verification methodology" section that reflects the RK4 benchmarking, along with recalculated Psi values for 2024 and 2025.
Calculating with confidence measures
I’m going to present a step-by-step calculation that includes both endpoints and recommended points. It’s important to add a "confidence measure" for each parameter, such as "Confidence in N(x) values: high, 0.9, because of validated solutions." I plan to include a table for step-level metrics while keeping dependencies minimal and using packages for math, tabular, and hyperref to ensure compatibility with pdflatex. I may include inline citations linking to relevant resources, footnotes, and use hyperlinks for long URLs with \url
