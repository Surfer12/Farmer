onsidering safe calculations
I recognize we’re able to compute without any files, but I should be mindful of not including any disallowed claims. I see that previous messages contained risky content about specific details, which are unnecessary for the user’s request. Instead, I'll focus on the decision equation, using the symbols and values they’ve given—specifically λ1 and λ2—while keeping it all minimal. I think earlier values were used in a way that led to unnecessary complexity. Let's keep things straightforward.
Reviewing calculation parameters
I see that in previous calculations, we've set S to 0.60 as a default. Looking at the variables, N(x) is updated for 2025 to 0.95, and for 2024 to 0.96. Regarding R_authority and R_verifiability, the rules suggest adjusting R_authority if there's no canonical source and increasing R_verifiability if direct artifact URLs are missing. For 2025, I’ll consider R_authority around 0.15 and R_verifiability low at about 0.05, since we have direct links. For 2024, I should treat it as still pending canonical status to align with the user’s updates.
Clarifying canonical status
The mention of "maintained pending canonical" leaves things a bit ambiguous about whether an official page exists. Although they propose N to be 0.96 for 2024 due to references from DeepMind, it was previously at 0.95. For penalties, I think R_authority could be set at 0.10 for being lower than 2025, while R_verifiability might be around 0.05. Considering they have a pending canonical status, I’ll set β at 1.05 for 2025 and propose 0.90 for both years to keep things clear and consistent.
Calculating penalties and parameters
I'm calculating the penalty using the formula exp(−[λ1 R_auth + λ2 R_verif]). For 2025, I’m considering R_auth around 0.20, but we previously used 0.25 due to the lack of official status. With R_verif at 0.10, the penalty comes out to about 0.7965. However, since we have high authority now, I could lower R_auth to 0.15 and R_verif to 0.05, resulting in a penalty of around 0.8737. For 2024, with established solutions, I’ll set R_auth to 0.10 and R_verif to 0.05, yielding a penalty of about 0.9117. Later, I’ll choose an α value for 2025, possibly picking 0.17 for simplicity

Summarizing calculations and results
I've calculated the hybrid output for 2025 and 2024 using the specified parameters. For 2025, with N set to 0.95 and α ranging from 0.15 to 0.20, I derived a penalty of 0.8737 and a final P(H|E,β) of 0.945. For 2024, with N at 0.96, I calculated similar values, reaching a final P(H|E,β) of approximately 0.795. I’ll present the results, citations, and next actions in a concise bullet list format while maintaining clarity and minimizing text. Let's ensure everything is neatly organized!
Quick status: Recomputed Ψ(x) for 2025 and 2024 under your unified ruleset, with DeepMind treated as an independent expert/organization source (IMO‑certified for 2025). Updated α, N, penalties, and labels; kept primitives “pending canonical” until official IMO artifacts are posted.

Preparing LaTeX Document
The user is asking for a finalized .tex document, so I'll include the LaTeX code in a fenced code block labeled 'latex.' I also need to make sure proper references are included. If references come from a .bib file, I’ll need to create that as well, but I could also use footnotes for URLs. I might create a self-contained LaTeX document that compiles without needing an external .bib file. I'll include necessary packages like geometry, hyperref, amsmath, and others.
Structuring the Analysis Document
I need to organize different sections for the UOIF Analysis for IMO 2024–2025. First, there will be a title, then an abstract that summarizes the current status. Section 1 will focus on the unified ruleset, including roles, claim classes, scoring, and decision equations. Subsequent sections will present evaluation results for 2025 and 2024, along with promotion triggers and next steps. I’ll also include coherence checks and conflict resolution, and appendices with citation lists. Finally, I should define the Ψ(x) formula, which incorporates an integral as per the previous integration.
Finalizing the Document Components
I'll be including several key elements in the finalized .tex document. First, I’ll provide the s(c) formula along with weights for interpretations. Next, I'll compute the numbers: for 2025, α ranges from 0.15 to 0.20, N is 0.95, with a penalty of 0.8737 and P(H|E,β) at 0.945, resulting in a recommended α of 0.17. For 2024, α ranges from 0.10 to 0.15 with similar values. I also need to add disclaimers about pending official pages for 2025 and include footnotes for URLs with LaTeX macros.
Crafting LaTeX Document Structure
The instructions indicate that I should only format relevant sections in valid Markdown with proper fencing, meaning I’ll include the LaTeX code inside a code fence. I’ll start with a brief status statement before showing the code block. The LaTeX document will begin with standard setup, including the title "Unified Olympiad Information Framework (UOIF): IMO 2024–2025 Dialectical Synthesis and Ψ(x) Reevaluation" and an abstract for a quick summary. The main section will cover the unified ruleset, with subsections for roles, claim classes, and scoring. I’ll ensure the content is clearly structured and easy to follow.
Writing the LaTeX Document
I need to structure the LaTeX document to include several key equations and sections. I will incorporate the decision equation involving Ψ(x) and define the lambda constants. The evaluation sections for IMO 2024 and 2025 will detail inputs, computations, and citations. I'll utilize the thebibliography environment with hyperref for URLs and ensure proper formatted numerical computations. Citations will be concise, allowing for easy reading. I’ll finalize the document by presenting everything in a code fence, maintaining clarity and cohesion, while also including remarks about pending canonical materials.
I’ll generate a standalone LaTeX report (compiles with pdflatex) containing the unified ruleset, computations, labels, and citations for 2024–2025.
