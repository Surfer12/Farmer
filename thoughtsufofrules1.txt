Considering file paths in Cursor
The tool indicates that we're starting at the project root in Cursor, but the workspace path isn't clear. I can create files with both relative and absolute paths, but the guidance suggests preferring absolute paths if possible. Since I don’t have that information, using relative paths should be okay. I could ask the user for a path, but the instructions say not to seek approval unless necessary. I think I can create a docs/ folder and write .tex files there using terminal commands.
Planning file creation with commands
The tool requires single-line commands, which complicates writing longer content since it can’t handle newlines. I can't use a here-doc because it’s multi-line. Another option is to utilize the functions.apply_patch tool to create or update files; it requires specifying a patch format. I believe I can create new files using apply_patch by indicating the file path and necessary content. I’m considering generating two files and possibly including a README or build script for compiling through pdflatex.
Using code edit tools for patches
According to the developer instructions, I should never output code directly to the user but instead use code edit tools. So, I'll use apply_patch to add the LaTeX files like docs/uoif_ruleset.tex and docs/uoif_reflection.tex. I need to ensure the content aligns with the updated ruleset, including official 2025 results and recomputed values. I'm not certain if the reflection document should include the ML verification methodology and the claims regarding Oates since the user's recent request didn't mention them.
Planning the reflection document
For the reflection document, I should include the recomputation for the 2025 results along with any pending 2025 problems and the 2024 recomputation. While including the verification methodology could be helpful, it might not be necessary since the user didn’t mention it. The earlier request was to create a LaTeX reflection document with confidence measures, so I’ll keep it concise and focused. The new task is to build a proposed ruleset and reflection document, with the ruleset reflecting the updated specifications and citations accordingly.
Planning file creation and patches
I’m noticing some inconsistencies with apply_patch, which needs a file path and patch but might treat the patch's file path differently. I think I’ll stick to using apply_patch primarily and add two files in one call to reduce complexity. After that, I’ll create a README file in a third call. 
I plan to generate the ruleset and reflection documents with detailed sections and content while ensuring all numbers align with the user’s previous computations. I’ll run these three apply_patch calls in parallel and summarize afterwards.
