# Making Risk Estimates More Reliable with Modern Uncertainty Quantification

---

## 1. Why Better UQ Matters

- **Separates ignorance from noise** → distinguishes *epistemic* vs. *aleatoric* uncertainty.
- **Actionable risk numbers**: tail probabilities, credible/prediction intervals, abstention triggers.
- **Calibration you can trust**: stated probabilities ≈ observed frequencies, boosting stakeholder confidence.

## 2. Core UQ Techniques

| Purpose | Recommended Methods |
| --- | --- |
| Epistemic uncertainty | **Deep Ensembles** (n≈5) — strong baseline |
| Lightweight Bayesian | MC-Dropout · SWAG · Laplace last-layer |
| Aleatoric uncertainty | Heteroscedastic heads (mean + variance) · Quantile regression (τ-quantiles) |
| Distribution-free guarantees | **Conformal prediction** for intervals/sets |
| Post-hoc calibration | Temperature scaling · Isotonic regression (verify with reliability diagrams) |
| OOD awareness | Dirichlet Prior Networks · Energy scores · Density/score-based detectors |
| Small-data regimes | Gaussian Processes · Bayesian linear heads |

## 3. Evaluating UQ Quality

- **Calibration**: ECE/ACE, reliability diagrams, Brier score, NLL.
- **Intervals/Sets**: coverage (PICP), width (MPIW), CRPS.
- **Shift & OOD**: AUROC, FPR@95 %TPR.
- **Decision quality**: expected-cost/utility curves, VaR, CVaR.

## 4. From UQ to Risk-Optimal Decisions

Mathematically choose the action that minimises expected cost:

\[a^* = \arg\min_a \; \mathbb{E}[C(a,Y) \mid X]\]

Tail-risk tools:

- \(P(Y \ge t \mid X)\)
- \(\mathrm{VaR}_{\alpha} = \inf\{t: F_Y(t) \ge \alpha\}\)
- \(\mathrm{CVaR}_{\alpha} = \mathbb{E}[Y \mid Y \ge \mathrm{VaR}_{\alpha}]\)

Selective prediction: abstain/escalate when entropy, variance, or conformal-set size exceeds a threshold. Pricing/allocations: add CVaR-based buffers; triage using predictive entropy.

```python
# Minimal decision pseudocode
# Inputs: p_y_given_x (distribution or samples), U(x)=uncertainty metric, S(x)=conformal set
if U(x) > tau or len(S(x)) > k_max:
    action = "abstain_or_escalate"
else:
    action = argmin_a_expected_cost(a_space, p_y_given_x)
return action
```

## 5. Monitoring & Guardrails (Production)

- **Drift**: PSI / KL / MMD on inputs; calibration drift on outputs.
- **Online calibration**: periodic temperature re-fit; conformal online updates.
- **Backtesting**: rolling coverage & loss audits; champion–challenger with canaries.
- **Governance**: log uncertainty signals & thresholds; route high-tail-risk cases to human review.

## 6. Quick-Start Implementation Plan

1. **Train** Deep ensemble (n = 5); add heteroscedastic or quantile heads for regression.
2. **Calibrate** Temperature-scale on held-out set; target ECE ≤ 2–3 %.
3. **Guarantee** Fit conformal residuals/scores → 90–95 % coverage with minimal width.
4. **Decide** Deploy expected-cost & CVaR rules; set abstention thresholds from validation.
5. **Monitor** Drift stats, rolling coverage, calibration drift; schedule online recalibration.
6. **Govern** Persist UQ features, decisions, and alerts; human review on tail events.

## 7. Targets & Success Criteria

- *ECE* ≤ 2–3 % in-domain.
- Conformal coverage within ±1–2 % of nominal.
- OOD *FPR@95 %TPR* well below in-domain baseline.
- Lower expected cost and tail losses (VaR / CVaR) vs. legacy system.

## 8. Link to the Ψ Framework

| Ψ Component | UQ Contribution |
| --- | --- |
| **Predictability** | Better calibration bolsters trust in predicted risks |
| **Verifiability (R_v)** | Reproducible Bayesian/ensemble UQ provides auditable evidence |
| **Authority (R_a)** | OOD-aware detectors improve robustness under shift |

Improving these components raises the overall Ψ score without amplifying over-confidence.
